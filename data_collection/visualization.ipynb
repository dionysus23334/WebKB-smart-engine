My Official Departmental Home Page. Cornell Robotics and Vision Laboratory Dan Huttenlocher and I founded the Cornell Robotics and Vision Laboratory in 1991. Research My interests include robotics  microelectromechanical systems  geometric algorithms  and artificial intelligence. Robotics is the science that seeks to forge an intelligent  computational connection between perception and action. Working with graduate student Jim Jennings  research associate Daniela Rus  graduate student Russell Brown  and lab alumnus Jonathan Rees (now at MIT)  we developed a team of autonomous mobile robots that can perform sophisticated distributed manipulation tasks (such as moving furniture). The robots run robust SPMD protocols that are completely asynchronous and require no communication. With grad student Karl B枚hringer and EE Professor Noel MacDonald  we are building a massively parallel array of microactuators in the Cornell National Nanofabrication Laboratory. The array is a SCREAM chip containing over 11 000 actuators in 1 square centemeter  and can orient small parts without sensory feedback. Our microfabricated actuator arrays could be used to construct programmable parts-feeders (at any scale)  or to build self-propelled IC s (walking VLSI chips.) Graduate student Amy Briggs worked with Dan Huttenlocher s vision group to develop a sensor planning and surveillance system for a team of mobile robots. The robots use on-board vision to detect and intercept targets in the lab. Demos Massively parallel micro-fabricated actuator arrays. MPEG video of Tommy chasing Lily. Tommy and Lily are mobile robots we built. Using algorithms developed by the vision group in our lab  Lily can track Tommy and follow him  using visual information alone.

Constable Robert L. Constable Department Chair/Professor rc@cs.cornell.edu Ph.D. University of Wisconsin  Madison  1968 Research We are engaged in the study of computer systems that provide mechanical assistance in problem solving  especially in programming and mathematics. This involves a long term study of ways to make the formalization of mathematics feasible and useful. We have implemented three such systems in the past tne years: PL/CV  PRL  and Nuprl. Our major experimentation is with Nuprl  a 60 000-line Lisp program that implements a constructive theory of types. Systems such as Nuprl are useful formalizations of mathematics because they can express a wide variety of proof and program-building methods as metalevel programs of the system. These provide considerable theorem proving power. Moreover  Nuprl is especially useful because it can evaluate the computational content of theorems. In principle  Nuprl is both a fomal system of mathematics and a programming language. We continue to improve Nuprl; the current version used at Cornell is called Nuprl 4. It differs from its predecessors in having a new term editor designed by Stuart Allen and implemented by Richard Eaton. Its internal structure is more modular  making the system suitable for he definition of a wide variety of logics beyond the built-in constructive type theory. Also  the entire theorem-proving mechanism has been rebuilt and stream-lined by Paul Jackson  building on the work of Douglas Howe. This contributes to the generic nature of Nuprl 4. Finally  this version of the system can refer to itself. There is an internal description of the language and its logic built principally by William Aitken using the theory developed by Allen  Howe  and myself. Richard Eaton designed a link between the internal description of the logic and the logic itself  which makes it possible to prove theorems about the process of proving theorems. We are also engaged in three exciting joint ventures. One is with Miriam Leeser of Electrical ENgineering and the other two are in Computer Science; with David Gries on Polya and with Richard Zippel on Weyl. With Lesser  we are involved in hardware synthesis and verification. Leeser and her student Mark Aagard have used Nuprl to prove the correctness of a 1000-line boolean circuit minimization package  Pbs  used by circuit designers. This is a component of Leeser s Bedroc system (it implements the weak division algorithm  which is widely used in circuit design systems). This major theorem proving effort taught us a great deal about the effectiveness of our technology in the hands of expert users from an application domain. The second joint venture involves building a model of the Polya programming language and a program refinement mechanism for it  both designed by David Gries  which will enable him to write his handbook of algorithms in the manner that he devised through years of study of the programming process. Stuart Allen has givne a formal type-theoretic definition of Polya. We expect to be experimenting soon with transforms and trying to capture the programming style that Gries wants. We have recently begun a collaboration that we hope to relate to the Polya effort. Conal Mannion has been exploring the possibility of using Nuprl in computational science. We have been discussing problems with Richard Zippel and are hoping to connect Zippel s symbolic algebra system  Weyl  with Nuprl in the near future. This will be used to explore the development of scientific computing software using Weyl and Nuprl together with other tools that Zippel is building.

I am particularly interested in the use of high-level languages  such as Standard ML  for building systems software  including run-time systems  operating systems  and distributed systems. Lately  I have focused on the implementation issues that have kept high-level  safe languages from being used in the construction of systems software. To this end  my research has concentrated on producing code for high-level languages that is faster  consumes less memory  and supports  hacking with the bits . I am also interested in bringing powerful  semantics-based tools from programming language theory  such as type-directed compilation  partial evaluation  abstract interpretation  and run-time code generation  into the design  specification  and construction of real systems software.

Our goal is to develop tools for generating parallel code for applications programs that deal with large sparse matrices. Most scientific applications involve the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The techniques used almost always produce a system of algebraic equations that involve large sparse matrices. Unfortunately  existing compiler technology does a poor job of parallelizing sparse matrix programs. We take a radically different approach to this problem. Our compiler produces parallel sparse-matrix programs from sequential dense-matrix programs  using information from the user about the sparsity structure of matrices in the program. This enables us to use tools from the restructuring compiler area. Preliminary experiments with some Krylov space solvers show that the code produced by our compiler is competitive with hand-parallelized code in libraries like Argonne s PetSc library. We will extend our approach to direct methods for solving linear systems and to applications that require adaptive mesh refinement. This project builds on our earlier work on restructuring compilation techniques for dense matrix programs. We have developed restructuring techniques for compiling programs to distributed memory and non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures like the IBM SP-2 and CM-5  where a processor can access local memory faster than non-local memory. To get good performance  the compiler must not only parallelize but must also ensure locality of reference by matching code and data distribution; when non-local references must be made  block transfers are preferable to many small messages. We recently developed the best algorithm known for the automatic alignment of computation and data and are incorporating it into our compiler test-bed. In earlier work  we developed a novel loop restructuring technique called access normalization  which transforms loop nests for increased locality and potential for block transfers  and implemented it in the LAMBDA loop transformation toolkit - our paper summarizing these results won the best paper prize at ASPLOS V. We worked with Hewlett-Packard to transfer this technology to HP s FORTRAN compiler product line for uniprocessors and multiprocessors. We have developed new frameworks for program analysis and optimization based on the dependence flow graph (DFG). The DFG knits together the data and control dependence information of a program  permitting the development of optimization algorithms that generate better code than is possible with competing approaches. Our results are of independent interest; for example  we recently developed optimal algorithms for control dependence problems  answering a foundational question that had been open for almost a decade. This work led to the development of a linear-time algorithm for computing the static single assignment (SSA) form of programs. These results have been incorporated into a number of compilers  including those at IBM  Microsoft  HP  and Flavors.

To this end  my research group  Project Zeno  is building technologies supporting the storage  communication  and processing of continuous media data. In contrast to other commercial and research approaches  which require specialized hardware  operating systems  or networks to be usable  all of these technologies we are designing fit into the current research environment. Our premise is that the current hardware  software  and communication infrastructure is sufficient to support research into continuous media systems and applications. We are verifying this hypothesis by building working systems. Our research on storage systems is directed towards building the Zeno distributed video file server. The Zeno architecture uses a network of workstations connected by a generic local area network (e.g.  an ethernet)  a common environment in computing research laboratories. Each workstation can act simultaneously as both a client and a server of continuous media data. As a client  a workstation plays video stored on one or more servers. As a server  a workstation is a file server for video data. Each client can receive video stored at several servers  and each server can service several clients. Compared with large centralized servers  the advantages of this design are: Scalability. As new clients are added  new servers are automatically added. Load balancing. The load generated by serving videos is distributed both across machines and across networks (in the case where the servers are located on different networks). Low initial investment. By utilizing existing infrastructure  the Zeno architecture promotes early adoption in research environments with almost no initial investment. Our research on communication systems is centered around best effort delivery protocols. Such protocols are built on existing network protocols and  in contrast to many other research efforts  do not need to reserve network resources to establish a connection. Resource reservation protocols are well suited to the national communication infrastructure where users can be charged on a per call basis for bandwidth and connections  but are poorly suited to network environments where the network is a shared resource equally accessible by all researchers. Our approach is appropriate for the latter environments  commonly found in research laboratories. The communication protocol we have developed  called Cyclic-UDP  is built on top of the UDP datagram protocol  and is designed to transport audio and video data in playback applications in local  metropolitan  and wide area networks. Cyclic-UDP is used by the Zeno file server to deliver audio and video data to clients. A paper describing cyclic UDP is available online   as well as the slides from a research talk. Our research on processing video data has been two-fold. First  we are developing algorithms to process video data in the compressed representation. Processing video without decompression leads to dramatic speed-ups in processing performance since it both removes the time-consuming processes of compression and decompression and reduces the amount of data that must be processed. Experiments with an implementation of these ideas on JPEG compressed image data indicates that the data can be processed one to two orders of magnitude faster than what was possible with previous approaches. We are currently extending these ideas by parallelizing the algorithms using networks of workstations and by developing a method for transcoding video in software. In video transcoding  video is translated from one compression format to another  a useful operation for video file servers that must service heterogeneous clients. A paper describing compressed domain processing is available online. Our research on video processing is also exploring methods to simplify experimentation with video processing by developing a programming language where video is a first class data type. This language  called Rivl (pronounced  rival )  allows video processing effects to be specified independent of the resolution and format of the source material. The language does for video what Postscript did for text and graphics: it provides a resolution independent method for specifying video processing. Thus  the same program can process low quality QuickTime video very quickly while editing decisions are made  and then be used to format a high quality finished product off-line  in much the same way that Postscript can be previewed on a workstation at low quality  then sent to a 2600 dpi printer for camera ready copy. A paper describing RVL is available online. A talk that reviews our research on video processing  both compressed domain processing and Rivl  is available online. The common theme of all these efforts is to provide tools to make video usable in our research environment. A talk that reviews this research is also available online.

I work on methodologies  paradigms  and algorithms for fault-tolerant distributed systems  in both message-passing and shared-memory systems. My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical results and the need for efficient and practical solutions. In collaboration with Tushar Chandra and Prasad Jayanti  two Ph.D. Computer Science students  we continued our work on unreliable failure detectors for message-passing systems  and on wait-free objects for shared-memory systems. A fundamental result of fault-tolerant distributed computing states that the Consensus problem cannot be solved (with a deterministic algorithm) in asynchronous systems. This impossibility result is due to the inherent difficulty of determining whether a process has crashed (or is merely very slow) in such a system. In our work  we were able to determine exactly how much information about failures is necessary and sufficient to solve Consensus. We first showed one can use W  an unreliable failure detector that can make an infinite number of mistakes  to solve Consensus in systems with a majority of correct processes. We then proved that to solve Consensus  any failure detector has to provide at least as much information about failures as W. Thus  W is the weakest failure detector for solving Consensus in asynchronous systems with a majority of correct processes. We are now exploring the practicality of implementing W  and of applications that rely on W for their correctness. A concurrent system consists of processes communicating via shared objects. A shared object is wait-free if each process that accesses this object is guaranteed to get a response even if all the other processes crash. We are now exploring wait-free hierarchies of object types  where each object (type) is assigned to a level that corresponds to its ability in implementing other wait-free objects. In particular  Prasad Jayanti has shown that a well-known hierarchy (Herlihy s) is not robust: Informally  in this hierarchy there is an object at level 2 that can be used to implement wait-free objects at any level. We are now exploring the question of whether robust wait-free hierarchies exist. Selected Publications Bracha  G.  and S. Toueg. Asynchronous consensus and broadcast protocols.

I received a B.S. Queens College in 1960 and went to work for the U.S. Naval Weapons laboratory (as a civilian) as a mathematician-programmer. I met my wife-to-be  Elaine  a few months later  and we were married in November 1961. We went to Illinois for more education. I received a Masters degree in math from Illinois in 1963. My assistantship was to help two Germans  Manfred Paul and Ruediger Wiehle  write a full Algol compiler for the IBM 7090 computer --it was fun  figuring out how to implement recursion efficiently before there were many papers on the topic. This ended up in my wife and I going to Munich for almost three years. I received my doctorate under F.L. Bauer and Joseph Stoer from MIT (the Munich Institute of Technology  Germany) in June 1966. This was in math  or numerical analysis  since computer science theses were not yet kosher. I was an assistant professor of Computer Science at Stanford from 1966 to 1969. While at Stanford  our twins Paul and Susan were born. What made it more exciting than usual was that they were born on the birthday of myself and my twin --26 April. So  when my twin is in town  Elaine makes four birthday cakes. We left Stanford because it had no weather. We moved to Cornell  which has weather  in 1969 and have been snowed in ever since. I was Department Chair in 1982-87  and I became the William L. Lewis Professor of Engineering in 1992. I had a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1984-85. Return to table of contents I am better known for my text writing and my contributions to education than on the wonderfulness of my research. Do what you are good at; bloom where you are planted. I have received a number of awards for contributions to education: the 1994 IEEE Taylor L. Booth Award  the ACM SIGCSE award in 1991  a Cornell Outstanding Educator Award in 1990  the Clark Award from Cornell s College of Arts & Sciences in 1986  and the American Federation of Information Processing Societies  (AFIPS) education award in 1985. I am proud of all my Ph.D. advisees  but two stand out. Susan Owicki s thesis laid the foundation for proofs of correctness of parallel programs  with the notion of interference-freeness. A paper co-authored by us on the topic won the 1977 ACM Award for best paper in programming langauges and systems. And T.V. Raman s thesis just won the ACM best-dissertation award for 1993-94. Raman designed and implemented a system for  speaking  any tex/latex document  including technical articles and books. The same document can be printed or spoken. Being able to speak mathematics in an effective manner was an important goal of his work. Reading for the Blind is already using his system to produce audio cassettes. I served as Chair of the Computing Research Association (then the Computer Science Board) in the late 1980 s when it opened its office in Washington and began seriously to represent computing research interests. I also conducted the Taulbee Surveys in the period 1984-1991 and am proud of obtaining essentially complete responses from PhD-granting computer science departments during that period. No other comparable survey has had such a response rate. One year  it required only 256 telephone calls to get the 150 departments to send in their questionnaires. I received the Computing Research Association s 1991 Service Award for this work on the Surveys and for chairing the Association during its move toward respectability and responsibility. I am currently editor for IPL  Acta Informatica  Formal Aspects of Computing  and Software Concepts and Tools. This editing keeps me busy  but I enjoy it. I try to take an interest in individual papers  when I know the area  and will suggest substantial rewrites myself when I believe it will help. Serve where you can best serve. Fred B. Schneider and I are co-editors of Springer Verlag Texts and Monographs in Computer Science. What do I do in my spare time? It used to be sports like golf  softball  volleyball  swimming and table tennis. (Once  in China  I split my pants playing ping pong. An hour later  while giving a lecture  I mentioned that the audience should not laugh when I turned around  and I explained why. The interpreter spoke  and everyone laughed. However  I don t know whether he told the truth or just said   Gries made a joke  laugh. .) I also used to sing barbershop and Gilbert and Sullivan. And working around the house --carpentry  wiring  remodeling-- has taken a lot of time and yielded considerable satisfaction. Return to table of contents',\n",

Greenberg Donald P. Greenberg Jacob Gould Schurman Prof. of Computer Science Director  NSF Science and Technology Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization PhD Cornell University  1968 For the past two decades  our computer graphics activities have involved the development of a wide range of graphic input and display techniques. A number of input methods have been implemented  and progress has been made on a large variety of display routines. Graphics research topics previously investigated include polygon clipping  hidden surface algorithms  texturing  spatial and temporal aliasing problems  geometric modeling  parametric surface descriptions  and color science. Our current focus of graphics research involves the three-dimensional modeling of very complex environments and algorithms for realistic image synthesis. A modular testbed that is sufficiently flexible to evaluate different modeling and image generation techniques has been created. Laboratory research is now being conducted on light reflection models  methods for determining the interaction between reflecting surfaces  techniques for improving the computational efficiency of ray-tracing  parallel processing strategies  perceptual studies  micro-geometry surface modeling  motion control  dynamics  constraint modeling  anti-aliasing strategies  and a host of other topics related to complex modeling and realistic image displays. New application research is being started in volume rendering and medical imaging  digital photography  animation  and the development of generic tools for scientific visualization  as well as core technologies for multi-media environments. Most of the research is conducted within the facilities of the Program of Computer Graphics  which is a member of the new National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization.

Large masses of machine-readable text now exist that can be cheaply stored on high-density optical storage media and rapidly retrieved on demand. Furthermore  sophisticated methods are available for analyzing document texts  formulating appropriate user queries  conducting rapid file searches  and ranking the retrieved items in decreasing order of importance to the users. At Cornell  we design and operate large  general-purpose text processing environments where texts can be handled without restrictions as to size or subject matter. In the absence of knowledge bases that would be useful for unrestricted text databases  we use corpus-based text analysis systems that determine the meaning of words and expressions by a refined context analysis using statistical and probabilistic criteria. Using the corpus-based approaches  we are able to determine text similarity with a high degree of accuracy. There are two main applications: The automatic generation of structured text collections (hypertext) where semantically similar pieces of text are automatically linked. Hypertext representations of large databases provide flexible browsing capabilities for general-purpose text access. The automatic retrieval of interesting text excerpts in response to available search queries. We have done extensive work with an automated encyclopedia consisting of about 25 000 encyclopedia articles (the Funk and Wagnalls New Encyclopedia). In addition  we are also processing the TREC collection consisting of about 800 000 full-text documents covering a number of different subject areas (over 2 gigabytes of text). A sophisticated search and retrieval service exists  as well as a text linking system capable of relating different text sections  paragraphs  and sentences. The main test vehicle continues to be the current version of the Smart text analysis and retrieval system  operating under UNIX on Sun Sparc Stations and Sun-4 terminal equipment.

Birman Kenneth P. Birman Professor PhD Univ. of California  Berkeley  1981 My research is concerned with fault-tolerant distributed computing and operating systems. My focus is on using a distributed programming model based upon virtual synchronous process groups to solve such problems as managing replicated data  coordinating actions in a distributed setting  and performing dynamic reconfiguration. This is done in a way that provides fault-tolerance  although it is limited to certain classes of reasonably benign failures. My effort has a theoretical and a practical side. The practical work started in 1985  when we developed a computing system called the Isis Toolkit. Isis  with software tools to support virtual synchrony and fault-tolerance  became widely popular. We are now developing a new system  Horus  which is intended to be more flexible than Isis and which addresses issues such as real-time communication and security. The most important feature of Horus is its extensive use of layering  which permits it to be reconfigured for special purposes. The basic idea is that Horus users should pay only for features that they actually use but should have available a very broad collection of options. Horus also seeks leverage from the emergence of ATM network technology and from communication techniques such as Active Messages  which originated in work on parallel supercomputers. Horus embodies an advanced security technology  developed by graduate students Mike Reiter and David Cooper  which is unusual in combining security  privacy  and high availability in a single package. On the more fundamental side of the effort  the Horus group is looking at techniques for specifying and proving properties of process-group structured systems. We are using the ML language to develop executable reference implementations of the major Horus layers  with the goal of using Constables Nuprl system to prove that the latter correctly implements the former. We are also studying extensions of the virtual synchrony model  notably in work by Roy Friedman on adding real-time guarantees to Horus and in work by Mark Hayden on support for probabilistic broadcast primitives and programming tools. Horus is very much a collaboration. The architecture and development side of the effort is headed by Dr. Robbert van Renesse  Werner Vogels and Roy Friedman. Six graduate students are working on aspects of the system  including the development of object-oriented programming tools for multimedia communication applications  security and privacy  high-speed protocols that exploit ATM  and other problems. We are also collaborating within the department  notably with Thorsten von Eicken and Brian Smith.

Before that  I spent five years at AT&T Bell Laboratories. This semester  I am teaching a course called Engineering Computer Networks. I am teaching from a textbook I just completed  which will be published by Addison-Wesley this December. Most of my research is in flow and congestion control  mostly for connectionless networks (such as the Internet). The one line summary of my thinking is: The one true religion is round-robin scheduling and packet-pair flow control. Let me explain what that means. Users can contend for a shared resource in one of two ways: first-come-first-served and round robin. Unlike first-come-first-served  round robin scheduling automatically allocates fair shares of a resource to users and protects well-behaved users from hogs. If all queueing points in a network implement round-robin  then end-systems can determine their available fair share service rate implicitly using the packet-pair technique. They can then use the time series of rates to do stable and intelligent flow control. Thus  round robin does implicit allocation of fair shares  and packet_pair does implicit determination of the fair share for flow control. In contrast  current proposals in the ATM Forum for flow control do neither round robin (considered to be too expensive) nor implicit determination of the rate (only possible with round robin). Maybe I was wrong the whole time ;-) I have been working since 1991 in building ATM networks. One of them was Xunet  a wide area ATM network that we built from scratch (routers  switches  all the software)  which was operational from 1992 to 1996. The other is IDLInet in collaboration with IIT Delhi  based on no-name PCs and equipment from Fore Systems and Zeitnet. IDLInet source code is now in the public domain and is available from the Native-mode ATM home page. The key feature in IDLInet is that the protocol stack is native-mode ATM  that is  an application gets to write directly to an ATM virtual circuit. We also support an OS-independent signalling API that is SPANS compliant. Finally  I have been goofing off building talking heads (facial animation) and a snooping car (the car sends video in nv format on the MBONE  and can be driven from a remote site over the Internet). Links Papers Here is a link to my papers. Most papers are available as postscript. REAL I have been building the REAL packet-level simulator since 1989 and still maintain it. It has been installed at over 300 sites (I have no idea how many people actually use it). Here is a link to REAL version 4.0. You can also get the simulator from here. The latest version is version 4.0  which I released in Fall  93. Version 5 is in the works  includes a Tcl-based GUI  and should be out by the end of  96 (if all goes well). Native_mode ATM Home Page My Name In the part of the world I come from (South India  Thanjavur District  to be precise)  people have only one name. They prefix it with their father s only name (and  sometimes  the village name). There is no surname. Thus  my only name is Keshav  and my father s name is Srinivasan. Unfortunately  when I fit this round peg into the square hole of US custom  my first name is my last  which can be confusing! Quotable Quotes  One ought  every day at least  to hear a little song  read a good poem  and  if it were possible  speak a few reasonable words   Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe.

In particular  we have a method for solving the nearest Kronecker product problem when the factor matrices are subjected to inhomogeneous constraints. Some applications in signal processing and Markov processes are solved as a result. Kronecker product descriptions for various fast wavelet transforms have also been derived. Our aim is to proceed by analogy to the FFT  where such descriptions have played an important role in the development of high-performance algorithms.

Read Professor of Engineering PhD California Institute of Technology  1955 The strategic goal of our research is to contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory of computational complexity. Computational complexity is the study of the quantitative laws that govern computation  and it is an essential part of the science base needed to guide  harness  and exploit the explosively growing computer technology. Computational complexity classifies problems by the amounts of various computational resources needed to solve them. This classification yields complexity classes  each of which consists of all problems that can be solved within a given computational resource bound. To gain a deeper understanding of what makes problems hard to compute  we explore various complexity classes  relations between these classes  and the internal structure of these classes. We also study the trade-offs between different computational resources in problem solving  with particular attention to sequential-time  parallel-time  nondeterministic-time  memory requirements  randomness as a computational resource  and interactive computing.

Schneider Fred B. Schneider Professor PhD State Univ. of N.Y.  Stony Brook  1978 Techniques for understanding concurrent programs are becoming increasingly important as distributed computing systems become widespread in mission-critical applications. My research has focused on the development of these techniques. I have been heavily involved in applying assertional reasoning to the design of concurrent  distributed  fault-tolerant  and real-time programs. I am completing a textbook on this subject. Along with David Gries  I continue investigations concerning our first-order equational logic E. This past year  we streamlined the inference rules and evaluated a number of techniques for handling undefined terms and partial functions. Thomas Bressoud and I completed building and analyzing our hypervisor-based implementation of replication management for HP s PA-RISC architecture. Our protocols ensure that the sequence of instructions executed by two virtual machines running on different physical processors are identical. The protocols also coordinate I/O issued by these virtual machines. Use of a hypervisor to implement replica coordination is attractive - at least  in theory. When replica coordination is implemented in a hypervisor  it instantly becomes available to all hardware realizations of the given instruction-set architecture  including realizations that did not exist when the hypervisor was written. Second  when replica coordination is implemented in a hypervisor  a single implementation suffices for every operating system that executes on that instruction-set architecture. Finally  by implementing replica coordination in a hypervisor  the applications programmer is freed from this task. Jointly with Dag Johansen (University of Troms酶  Norway) and Robbert van Renesse  I started the TACOMA project (Troms酶 And COrnell Moving Agents) to investigate support and use of mobile processes in building mission-critical applications. By structuring a system in terms of agents  applications can be constructed in which communication-network bandwidth is conserved. Data may be accessed only by an agent executing at the same site as the data resides. An agent typically will filter or otherwise reduce the data it reads  carrying with it only the relevant information as it roams the network. Two TACOMA prototypes have been completed  and we are implementing a third system based on our experiences. Finally  I developed with Scott Stoller a new algorithm for detecting whether a particular computation of an asynchronous distributed system could have passed through a global state satisfying some given state predicate. The new algorithm allows more efficient detection than is possible with previous algorithms.

The NLP group at Cornell is primarily interested in investigating the use of machine learning techniques as tools for guiding natural language system development and for exploring the mechanisms that underly language acquisition. Our work focuses on two related areas: (1) the design of user-trained systems that can efficiently and reliably extract the important information from a document  and (2) the machine learning of natural language. Information Extraction. As part of Cornell s CSTR project  we are using information extraction techniques to support content-based browsing of technical texts. The Kenmore Project. The focus of the Kenmore project is on developing techniques to automate the knowledge acquisition tasks that comprise the building of any NLP system. Very generally  Kenmore acquires linguistic knowledge using a combination of symbolic machine learning techniques and robust sentence analysis. It has been used with corpora from two real-world domains to perform part-of-speech tagging  semantic feature tagging  and concept activation and to find the antecedents of relative pronouns. In current work  we are extending Kenmore to handle larger text corpora and additional disambiguation tasks. In all of our work  we evaluate the language learning components in the context of the larger NLP application in which it is embedded. The goal of the project is to determine the conditions under which machine learning techniques can be expected to offer a cost-effective approach to knowledge acquisition for NLP systems.

(Queen s)  M.Sc.  Ph.D. (Toronto) I am a faculty member at the University of Saskatchewan  where I teach and do research in computer systems in the Department of Computer Science. I am the Department s Graduate Chair for 1996/97. More information about our graduate program is available from the Department s Home Page. Please direct all graduate program inquiries to the Department s Graduate Secretary. In broad terms  my research relates to computer systems design and performance evaluation  with a particular focus on operating systems  distributed systems  and computer networks. Details of specific research projects are given below. I collaborate in these areas with researchers at Saskatchewan and elsewhere  including TRLabs  IBM Canada s Centre for Advanced Studies in Toronto  and Hewlett-Packard. Classes for 1996/97 I am teaching three classes this year: Fall Term: CMPT 215.3 Introduction to Computer Organization and Architecture CMPT 815.3 Computer Systems and Performance Evaluation Spring Term: (We have no winter term in Saskatchewan) CMPT 115.3 Principles of Computer Science Research Projects At the U of S  my research activities are rooted in the DISCUS Research Group  a group we (Derek Eager  Carey Williamson  and I) formed to consolidate our common research interests in the performance of distributed computing environments. Along with my graduate students  I am presently engaged in a variety of projects  including: system and networking issues in mobile computing multi-level file caching in client/server environments performance issues in OSF DCE (as part of the MANDAS project in collaboration with IBM Canada and colleagues at five other universities) network management in ATM networks. Recent papers in these and other areas are available from the DISCUS ftp server  along with completed theses of recent students.

Lee Associate Professor. Ph.D.  Stanford University Numerical computation is trivial  dull  and definitely not interesting. The interesting things are all related to non-numeric computation; the single most important and absolutely the most interesting area is in natural language understanding. We need more serious studies of how computers will continue to change society. The overall social impact of computers is going to be far greater than anyone now (except possibly a few science fiction writers) realizes - and the most important aspect of this impact will be on how we come to view humans and human nature. The dangers to society from the uncritical use of computers are largely ignored. Observe that the largest portion of the research budget supporting computer engineering  computer research  etc.  comes  either directly or indirectly from the military. I am interested in developing a designer workstation to teach computer science students how to design algorithms  such as is done in introductory courses. Such a designer station might manipulate Nassi-Schneiderman-like design diagrams. After the designs were complete  one could issue a command to generate the appropriate code and  finally  the code would be executed. I am retiring from MSU in a year and will not be taking on any addtional research assistants. email: lee@cps.msu.edu',\n",

The reconfigurable distributed services that we have built so far are re-implementations of standard services (e.g.  file service  X11 window service  IP) employing new algorithms internally that facilitate the following: operation in spite of disconnection and/or intermittent connection efficient use of limited bandwidth (wireless links current operate only at kilobit-to-megabit speeds) dynamic service location dynamic load balancing (to improve latency and throughput) I will continue to work on mobile computing during the next few years  focusing on these new projects: making applications aware of  and able to react to  changes in their location techniques for automatically and dynamically re-partitioning the function of a program into a client portion (running on a mobile computer) and a server portion (running on a stationary ``infrastructure   machine) exploitation of low power  solid state non-volatile storage technologies  such as flash EEPROM -- these devices are especially well suited to portable computers a new architecture for distributed systems supporting mobility in which an intermediary is interposed between client and server; the purpose of the intermediary is to intelligently filter all but the most essential data traveling from the infrastructure out to the mobile host Sabah S. al-Binali Fri Sep 22 16:39:42 EDT 1995',\n",

Hughes Professor. Ph.D.  Southwest Louisiana University Research and Teaching Interests: One great challenge that faces broadband networks is the ability to provide guaranteed performance to diverse traffic types based on their quality of service (QoS) requirements  while at the same time efficiently utilizing the network capacity. Many issues are involved in such performance-driven problems  including the type of guarantees required  traffic characteristics  congestion control mechanisms implemented at various nodes along the patch  bandwidth allocation algorithms  and buffer management schemes. Altogether  these factors determine the performance of the network. Therefore  the main goal of my research is to develop efficient techniques and accurate models that can be used to provide QoS guarantees for communicating sessions in ATM-based networks. Relevant issues will be studied during the course of this research by using actual performance data from our ATM testbed. Examples of general research topics within the domain of QoS which are currently being studied include: characterization of multimedia traffic bandwidth allocation algorithms buffer management schemes traffic policing mechanism Teaching Information: CPS 807 Information (Spring 1995) CPS 422 Information (Fall 1995) Contact information : Herman D.

My dissertation research focused on adaptive problem solving; that is  flexible problem solving approaches that improve their behavior through experience. I developed a statistically rigorous learning approach for improving problem solving performance and demonstrated its effectiveness on a prototype scheduling system being developed for NASA. This learning system improved scheduling performance over problem distributions based on actual NASA mission requirements. For more information  look at my statement of research interests.

She has been a member of the CS faculty at Vassar since 1982. She earned her B.A.  B.S.  M.A.  M.S.  and Ph.D. from The Pennsylvania State University. In addition to core computer science courses  Professor Ide teaches courses in Language Theory and Automata  Compiler Design  and Natural Language Processing. Professor Ide s area of specialization is computational linguistics. She has written a textbook for introductory computing as well as numerous papers in the fields of computational linguistics  computational lexicography  and humanities computing. She recently stepped down after ten years as president of the Association for Computers and the Humanities. She is co-editor-in-chief of the journal Computers and the Humanities  and co-edits two book series: Text  Language  and Speech Tecnhology  with Kluwer Academic Publishers  and Research in Humanities Computing  with Oxford University Press. In addition to co-editing several volumes in the Research in Humanities Computing series  Professor Ide recently co-edited The Text Encoding Initiative: Background and Context  published by Kluwer Academic Publishers. In 1987  Professor Ide initiated the international Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)  supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities  the European Union  and the Andrew K. Mellon Foundation. This ongoing international project produced the TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange in 1994. These guidelines are an application of SGML (ISO 8879:1986  Information Processing--Text and Office Systems--Standard Generalized Markup Language) designed to enable the encoding of the full range of text types for use in different applications. In 1988 Professor Ide co-established a collaborative project between Vassar College s Department of Computer Science and the Laboratoire Parole et Langage (LP&L) of the The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Aix-en-Provence  France. The US portion of the collaborative project is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF RUI grant IRI-9413451). The project has been concerned with the extraction and structuring of lexical and semantic knowledge extracted from machine readable dictionaries  and has grown to be one of a few major international projects in computational lexicography. Currently the project s focus is on the representation and of linguistic corpora and the development of tools for linguistic corpus annotation  and on the development of a Corpus Encoding Standard for such corpora. Through the Vassar/CNRS collaboration Professor Ide has been involved in creating and is currently working within the European projects MULTEXT and MULTEXT-EAST. She is also a member of the European project EAGLES  in which she serves as head of the EAGLES Text Representation subgroup. NAVIGATOR | Top | CS Dept home page |',\n",

M.Sc.  B.Ed. (Sask)  Ph.D. (Waterloo) I am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan . My area of academic research is ``uncertainty in artificial intelligence  . For more than a decade  I have been interested in the application of probability theory to problems in Artificial Intelligence traditionally handled by logics  grammars and heuristics. In AI s earliest days  it was widely held that complexity problems and the unavailability of meaningful probability distributions made this impractical. In the last decade  this opinion has changed. Two major international conferences  one organized by the Association for Uncertainty in AI and one organized by the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Statistics   discuss probabilistic and statistical AI  and statistical approaches to AI problems have entered the AI mainstream. Together with colleagues and students  I have looked at probabilistic approaches to default inference  diagnosis  temporal reasoning  natural language  and classification. My work appears in major journals and several national and international workshops and conferences. I have also edited a special issue of Computational Intelligence journal on the philosophy of nonmonotonic reasoning  featuring a target article by Henry E. Kyburg  Jr. .

Beckmann Assistant Professor of Engineering Thayer School of Engineering Dartmouth College 8000 Cummings Hanover  NH 03755-8000 603-646-1251 Carl.Beckmann@Dartmouth.EDU Condensed Bio Personal Home Page Carl Josef Beckmann  Assistant Professor of Engineering  graduated with a B.S. in engineering magna cum laude from Brown University  where he was also elected to Tau Beta Pi  the engineering honor society. He spent three years as a research scientist at the Honeywell Systems and Research Center before returning to school  this time to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for an M.S. and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering  on a Shell Doctoral Fellowship. During these five years  he also served as research assistant at the University s Center for Supercomputing Research and Development. His research and teaching interests include parallel computer architecture  parallelizing compilers  dynamic scheduling and synchronization of parallel programs  computer performance analysis  and networked multimedia.  People will always want computers to do more and to do it faster. However  what I call  the cylinder theory of computing  is a myth: in a car  if you want more power  you add more cylinders. It s a lot trickier with computers. There are problems with how you put the hardware together and in how you break down the software so it can be processed in parallel.  Carl Beckmann has been interested in both aspects ever since completing his thesis on high-performance computing and parallel processing using multiple computing elements simultaneously to achieve greater processing power.  Making good compilers for parallel machines is difficult. So is measuring and improving their performance   he explains.  But it s essential. Measurement can pinpoint where a computer is having problems. Then you can address those problems either by manual reprogramming or by making a better compiler that s able to handle those rough spots.  Specifically  since coming to Thayer School in January 1994  Professor Beckmann has been working with Professor George Cybenko on  networked interactive multimedia computing  a new field sited precisely at the point where computers  communications  and television converge.  The proliferation of user-friendly microcomputers  the widespread use of modems  and the explosion of publicly available information that is now accessible from thousands of miles away means that more and more computers are becoming linked together in large-scale networks. It s inevitable that the more people use these networks  the more they will get bogged down.  Beckmann s interest is in finding ways to minimize these emerging problems by developing ways to measure and optimize the performance of networked systems.  Industry people are mainly interested in building new systems  as fast as they can  because whatever they come up with today is bound to be an improvement over what s already out there. Later  they ll be coming to people like us  when they find the information superhighway isn t wide enough to handle all the traffic they re generating.  Beckmann and Cybenko are also working with Professor Joe Henderson of the Dartmouth Medical School  who is pioneering the development of multimedia applications for medicine. Ironically  widespread use of Henderson s innovative applications will create limitations in their performance. Beckmann and Cybenko are designing ways of measuring and modeling their performance and optimizing their realworld usefulness. Although he had not taught before coming to Thayer School  just three days after arriving in Hanover  Beckmann was asked to teach ENGS 67  Microprocessors in Engineered Systems  a lab course involving making nifty things out of microprocessors  requiring a little bit of hardware  a lot of software  and a great deal of patience.  Although it was daunting at first  I learned that if you can get the students excited about something and show them that this is really interesting stuff  they ll go off and do a lot of the learning on their own.

Given the rapidly changing scenario in research  I believe that a healthy mix of theory and applications is perhaps the most appropriate strategy. Currently  with my students and I am most actively working on the following topics: Applications of Control Technology to Microelectronics Manufacturing Processes Robust Control Theory Control Oriented Identification and Modeling Applications of Control to Automotive  Xerography  and Electromechanical systems In a major interdisciplinary research thrust  a group of faculty from the control systems laboratory and the solid state electronics laboratory has started a new research program on applications of control technology to semiconductor and display manufacturing processes. We have several projects in this area. I am the Center Director for the MURI Center on Intelligent Electronics Manufacturing. The main research thrusts of this center include modeling  sensing  and control of plasma etching and deposition processes. I am also a Thrust Group Leader in the Center for Display Technology and Manufacturing and a participating faculty member in the SRC Center of Excellence on Automated Semiconductor Manufacturing. These activities are also focused on applications of modern control and systems theory to plasma based microelectronics manufacturing processes. In our initial work  we have focused on real time and run-to-run control of plasma reactive ion etching process which is a major unit process step. Starting from a conceptual control strategy  we have designed and implemented a real time control system for this process on an Applied 8300 Hexode reactor. Experimental results have shown that real time feedback control could have major impact on the performance characteristics of the reactive ion etchers. More recently  we have developed nonlinear estimators for calculating etch rate from single/multiple wavelegth laser inteferometers. We have also developed a combined run-to-run and real-time controller for the RIE process. In control theory  our research is analysis and synthesis of control systems that give optimal performance given an approximate model of the physical system to be controlled. This is an extremely important problem since in practice one rarely has an exact model for the physical system. Modeling uncertainty arises due to incomplete and inexact experimental data  simplifying approximations  neglected high frequency dynamics  etc. Our research has focused on the problem of robust stabilization for a variety of possible modeling uncertainties. Our results have yielded necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of robust stabilization problems and constructive algorithms for solving these problems. This research is also closely connected to our work on H-infinity optimal control. A new development in our research on robust control is the analysis and synthesis of robust sampled-data control systems. Here we have focused on developing analytical tools for robustness analysis and synthesis of sampled-data systems in H-two and H-infinity norm. Models are the basis for much of control systems analysis and design. In a new major effort  we have begun research in empirical model building  i. e.  system identification. We are exploring frequency domain techniques for building system models which are suitable for robust control analysis and design. We have applied some of this recent work to the reactive ion etching problem as well as to the JPL example. More recent work has focused structured nonlinear models  such as Hammerstein systems  from empirical data. We are also actively pursuing applications of modern control and systems techniques to automotive systems. Our initial work focused on an idle speed fluctuation reduction problem where a novel nonlinear control strategy has given promising results on nonlinear simulations. More recently  we have focused on modeling and control of single and double transition shift transmissions. This work is being done in collaboration with engineers from General Motors. In collaboration with engineers at Xerox and Professor Dan Koditschek  we have started a new project on control of the color xerography process.

Research Interests Computer Chess (Crafty) This research is developing the computer chess program  Crafty   which is a direct descendent of Cray Blitz  the World Computer Champion from 1983 to 1989. This program is a  freeware  package available from ftp.cis.uab.edu/pub/hyatt. Crafty is based on the classic BITMAP approach to representing the chess board  but uses a unique methodology called  rotated bitmaps  to significantly improve the performance of the chess engine. This program is currently searching around 80 000 nodes per second on a P6/200 processor  and is playing on ICC and chess.net regularly. Its current ICC ratings are 2610 (bullet)  2750 (blitz) and 2533 (standard). Crafty is portable  and uses xboard/winboard as a GUI under the appropriate operating systems. The current work is concentrated in three areas: using parallel machines to search deeper into the game tree  inproving the chess knowledge contained in the program so that it plays better positional chess and also so that its strategy is goal-oriented rather than random  and improving the search strategies so that the program analyzes deeper in those positions that require it without wasting time on deep searches for those positions that do not need it. Parallel Architectures and Software This research studies various parallel machine architectures and how they can best be used to improve the speed of software applications. These architectures pose different problems that must be addressed when developing parallel algorithms for them. Various types of parallel systems are being studied  including shared memory systems  distributed systems  and a distributed group of shared memory multiprocessors. Research into this last group is being supported by Cray Research in order to learn how to use multiple Cray XMP and YMP computer systems to solve a single problem. Algorithm design  debugging  and performance analysis of parallel algorithms are being studied in order to inprove the execution speed of parallel code. This research has produced  Tuple-Space   a distributed processing programming environment that greatly simplifies the programming effort required to distribute an application. This system is continually being revised as it is used in various research projects. Education BS  University of Southern Mississippi  1970. MS  University of Southern Mississippi  1983.

Robert Skeel is interested in computational methods for biomolecular modeling  which is of great importance in structural biology and drug design and require the use of high-performance computers. The goal is to find faster ways to do the computations  especially through the application of advanced numerical techniques  and parallel algorithms. Current work centers on further development of NAMD-an object-oriented parallel molecular dynamics program  which is part of MDScope-a computational environment for structural biology. This work is done in collaboration with L. V. Kale  Klaus Schulten  and other members of the Theoretical Biophysics Group. In particular  this work involves a classical mechanics model of atomic interactions. In order to effect massive reductions in the computation requirements  it is necessary to find ways to take much larger time steps and ways to compute electrostatic interactions more quickly. In the future it is also hoped that a systematic way can be found to reduce the degrees of freedom. Skeel s sources of research funding include NSF and NIH.

His research is driven by relevant applications developed as part of a multidisciplinary laboratory at Georgia Tech -- the HPPCEL Laboratory contains uniprocessor and multiprocessor supercomputers (a Cray machine  an IBM SP-2  and networked sets of workstations like IBM RS6000  SUN and SGI machines). His research is also driven by the future heterogeneous SMP and distributed systems infrastructure experienced in commercial and research settings -- the Distributed Laboratories project is constructing a heterogeneous computing environment consisting of ATM-networked uniprocessor and SMP machines  jointly offering the computational power and interconnection bandwidth of modern supercomputers. Applications and the HPPCEL Laboratory. The HPPCEL Laboratory for experimentation with parallel applications is undertaking the development of several sample  large-scale parallel applications jointly with end users ( atmospheric modeling  finite element codes  fluid flow applications). In each case  these `applications  not only consist of specific computational tasks  but also include online analyses being performed for these computations and real-time visualizations of program data and monitoring of performance information  all of which are executed simultaneously such that end users can inspect program results and steer program executions to gain experimental insights. Additional applications used to evaluate operating system support  program adaptation  and programming environments research have included: (a) robotics applications and real-time simulations (the ASV autonomous suspension vehicle  schema based robot navigation  and discrete event simulations)  (b) real-time multi-media applications involving multiple machines and human end users  (c) the design and implementation of interactive graphical interfaces for high performance applications  and (d) graph-based searching algorithms used in the solution of Operations Research problems. Distributed Laboratories. The topic of our joint research is the realization of distributed laboratories  where individuals can interact with each other  and more importantly  with powerful  distributed computational tools as readily as if all were located in a single site. Our intent is to permit scientists  engineers  and managers at geographically distinct locations (including individuals ``tele-commuting   from home) to combine their expertise in solving shared problems  by allowing them to simultaneously view  interact with  and steer sophisticated computations executing on high performance distributed computing platforms. Prof. Schwan s primary contribution to this effort concerns the construction of a distributed laboratory for experimentation with high performance numeric computations for applications in molecular physics  atmospheric sciences  working with high performance atmospheric and pollution modelling  and manufacturing systems. In addition  Prof. Schwan s group is involved in the development of basic technologies facilitating the use of future heterogeneous and large-scale distributed and parallel systems. These technologies are concerned with ``middleware   software that will be directly utilized by distributed laboratory applications and described in more detail below: The Falcon project is studying the dynamic monitoring  adaptation  and interactive steering of high performance computations for on-line control of ``virtual laboratory instruments   and for ``what-if?   experimentation with complex simulation models by distributed laboratory users. The COBS project is concerned with the distributed systems and communication technologies underlying distributed laboratory applications. The emphasis in distributed systems research is on support for shared-state in multi-granular and distributed computing environments. Research in communication protocols is concerned with providing the necessary communication latencies  bandwidths  and transmission guarantees across heterogeneous underlying communication media. Prof. Schwan s current research addresses three basic research topics addressing the computational requirements and underlying hardware systems presented by the HPPCEL and Distributed Laboratory efforts: programming support tools  operating systems  and communication protocols. Programming tools - FALCON. The FALCON project addresses the construction of interactive parallel programs  even permitting programmers to `steer  such applications. Steering may be defined as: Program Steering - A program that can interact with human users during its execution  where the purpose of such interactions is the use of on-line program information to affect or `steer  program execution. The FALCON project s goal is to have high performance programs become equally interactive as commonly used PC tools (e.g.  spreadsheets) such that program performance is either maintained or improved! The expectation is that scientists can work more effectively when able to view program results during execution and steer program execution toward useful data domains. The initial experience is that on-line steering can improve the performance of programs by avoiding needless execution and by adapting (algorithmically) specific program abstractions to better match their functionality to dynamically varying program characteristics. In essence  we expect to gain significant increases in the usefulness of parallel programs to end users and in program performance by use of steering. FALCON offers specific support for program performance monitoring  evaluation  and tuning  and they provide system integration support using an incore data dictionary. Using FALCON  information required for performance tuning is easily captured  analyzed  displayed  and then used for program performance improvement. Program monitoring is performed in an identical fashion for both shared and non-shared memory parallel machines  using language-based and graphical user interfaces. Using programming extensions of FALCON now under development  program tuning is performed graphically  as well  by explicit manipulation of parallel programs displayed as hierarchical sets of related objects. The tools will be used in the context of large-scale parallel applications being interactively steered by end users. The FALCON tool is operational on SUNs  SGIs  IBM RS/6000  IBM SP-2 and the KSR machine. FALCON s programming extensions are still under construction  but their runtime support is already operational. Adaptable Operating Systems. The efficient execution of a parallel program requires that operating system primitives match the program s performance and reliability requirements. By constructing and evaluating novel operating system mechanisms for multiple parallel architectures  we are studying high-performance operating system support for multiple parallel applications  including real-time applications  scientific and engineering codes  discrete event simulations  and optimization codes. This research has resulted in several software libraries that facilitate the construction of parallel programs. The `Cthreads  library is commonly used in operating systems and parallel computing courses and is available on many uniprocessor and multiprocessor machines. Its extensions toward `Configurable CThreads  address the on-line monitoring and configuration of high performance parallel programs  ranging from the rapid adaptation of individual program abstractions to user-directed program steering. Specific examples of configurable abstractions constructed with the CThreads basis include (1) adaptable multiprocessor locks able to improve program performance by adapting lock characteristics to program behavior during program execution and (2) adaptable communication protocols The DSA (Distributed Shared Abstractions) library for construction of distributed objects is available on shared and (in a prototype version) on distributed memory machines  including networks of workstations. Its purpose is to support programmers in the construction of efficient program abstractions capable of spanning both shared memory and distributed memory platforms. Its initial SMP prototype is now being extended to address both sets of platforms  including larger scale distributed systems (see the COBS project described below). The Kernel ToolKit (KTK) is a substrate for parallel programming and for the development of multiprocessor operating system kernels. At the object-level  it gives developers the ability to construct custom implementations of object-based operating system abstractions. Objects are customized using meta-object-like interfaces described by `object attributes  and implemented by `policies . Since policies may be present at runtime  KTK objects may also be dynamically adapted to suit varying runtime requirements of parallel and distributed applications. KTK`s attributes are the principal basis for construction of adaptable objects in the COBS project described next.

Equally importantly  recent research is addressing the formulation and support of timing constraints for distributed information systems offering both program-program communications and human interactive services. For such systems  a benchmark application being developed by our group is able to emulate the behavior of video delivery systems and of more dynamic systems like those GIT-CC-94-29 PORTS: Experiences with a Scheduler for Dynamic Real-Time Systems Authors: Kaushik Ghosh  Richard M.

Differential equations and differential-algebraic systems arise in a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications. Differential-algebraic equations often occur as differential equations which are subject to constraints. The constraints may be linear or nonlinear  equality or inequality. DAE systems arise frequently as initial value problems in the computer-aided design and modeling of mechanical systems subject to constraints (multibody systems)  circuit simulation  flowsheeting for chemical processes  modeling of the flow of incompressible fluids  and in many other applications. Boundary value problems in DAEs arise in parameter estimation and control for multibody systems and for chemical processes and determination of periodic solutions for circuits. The presence of the constraints in a DAE system leads to an interesting mathematical structure and presents challenges for numerical algorithms. Current research focuses on numerical methods for real-time simulation of mechanical systems  parameter estimation and optimal control of differential-algebraic systems  and parallel methods and software for very-large-scale systems of DAEs in geophysics and other applications.

Kender Next: Shape from Darkness Up: Faculty Research Guide Previous: Gail E. Kaiser John R. Kender Research Area: Computer Vision  Robotic Navigation  Artificial Intelligence My main research interests center around the higher levels of computer visual perception of objects and space. These higher levels involve surfaces  volumes  place locations  topological relationships  and verbal descriptions. This is the mental landscape in which vision meets mainstream AI  and where knowing the  where  of things is more important than knowing what the  what  of things are. This research most recently has had four components. The most classical component is the development of shape from darkness  a (non-human) method to determining object surface shape from the shadows that the object casts  including shadows that it casts on itself. Less classical are two researches into navigation and description. The first of these uses topological relationships of objects to describe a navigational path without using metric quantities: this is qualitative direction giving  without the use of compass or odometer  much as people do on the back of an envelope. The second explores how the location of a single object in a cluttered enviroment can be described purely in spatial terms: medical radiologists do this for a living. The final investigation seeks to develop a Cheshire mouse: an indicating and selecting input device that requires no instrumentation other than the images of the moving and gesturing hand. Like Carrol s Cheshire cat  all that remains of the standard mouse is the smile (on the hand of the user). We review these four investigations in order  from most classical in terms of vision research  to most multidisciplinary. We state what the objective of each is  summarize current progress  and sketch one or two areas of further research that would have the most scientific and engineering payoff.

He received his Ph.D. in education and computer science (a joint degree) at the University of Michigan in 1993  where he developed Emile  an environment for high school science learners programming multimedia demonstrations and physics simulations. He is also the designer of MediaText  a multimedia composition environment used in elementary and high school classrooms. Mark is a member of the GVU Center  the Cognitive Science program  and the EduTech Institute. Mark recently co-organized a workshop with Rick Weingarten of Computing Research Association for the National Science Foundation. The charge of the workshop was to set a research agenda for Computer Science in Educational Technology. The draft report from that workshop is available on-line. Current Areas of Interest Educational computing  software-realized scaffolding  construction and design environments for students  constructionism  collaboration support  log file analysis and visualization  computational science (computer modeling  simulation  and visualization) for students Mark Guzdial s current research centers on facilitating student learning through student design  construction  and analysis of artifacts. Philosophically  he is a constructivist  even a constructionist  but he sees a need for support to enable and facilitate a student s construction of artifacts and knowledge. His goal is to provide to students similar kinds of opportunities that professional scientists and engineergs have for learning and exploring through computation. He has developed simulation environments for learning science through construction  and is now exploring visualization and collaboration environments to facilitate science and engineering learning. To evaluate the usability and learnability of the environments he creates  Mark is developing techniques for analysis of user event traces (log files). Recent Classes with Interesting Home Pages CS 2390 Modeling and Design  Winter  96 which is where  WebCaMILE was first used in CS 2390. CS 2390 Modeling and Design  Spring  96 where STABLE was first used. CS 6398  Design and Evaluation of Educational Software CS 2390 Modeling and Design  Fall  96 Current Research Projects NSF Multimedia Courseware Project: With John Stasko and Jim Foley  I am working on creating effective multimedia courseware for Computer Science courses using WWW. Software-Realized Scaffolding and Learner-Centered Design: The design of Emile revolved around providing software-realization of what educators called scaffolding  support which enables students to perform activities and to learn through those activities. In collaboration with Elliot Soloway  Kenneth E. Hay  and Yasmin Kafai  an interface design emphasis on learner-centered design is evolving  part of which is software-realized scaffolding. CaMILE (Collaborative and Multimedia Interactive Learning Environment) is a new learning environment designed to support students in collaboration with multimedia annotations. CaMILE can be seen as MediaText on a network. DEVICE (Dynamic Environment for Visualization in Chemical Engineering: DEVICE is an environment in which Chemical Engineering students learn through a process of design in a simulated world. DEVICE is being developed by Noel Rappin. The eventual goal is to merge DEVICE-like simulation support with CaMILE-like collaboration tools to create broad-based support for learning in Chemical Engineering -- SCOPE  Scaffolded and COntextualized Programming Environments for Engineering Education. This project is sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Log file analyses and visualizations are used to understand the effectiveness of the supports provided in these environments. Cognitive Multimedia: A project with John Stasko  Richard Catrambone  Ashwin Ram  and Mike Byrne  sponsored by ONR  focuses on trying to understand the most effective ways to construct interactive multimedia. Generalized Scaffolding: STABLE is a first attempt at creating generalized scaffolding -- not modifying the environment  but providing scaffolding  multiple representations  generic  plan  libraries (a la GPCeditor or Emile)  and collaborative environments in support of an existing work environment (VisualWorks Smalltalk). STABLE is being tested in CS 2390 during Spring  96. Instructions on how to create STABLE cases are available. Research Projects from the University of Michigan Working with Elliot Soloway and Elliot s Highly Interactive Computing Environments group  Mark was primarily involved in three projects at the University of Michigan. GPCeditor (Goal Plan Code Editor) is a Pascal programming environment that provides explicit supports for student design. MediaText is a multimedia composition environment for grades 6-12 students. Mark designed MediaText with Elliot  and MediaText is now a commercial product developed by Constructive Instruments and distributed by Apple Computer and Wings for Learning. Emile is a programming environment for science students exploring physics by creating simulations. Emile was Mark s dissertation work. Emile implements software-realized scaffolding which provides adaptable levels of support. Copies of recent AERA  95 papers are available in WWW formats.

Valiant Leslie Valiant Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics THEORY OF COMPUTATION AND MACHINE LEARNING Complexity theory  the study of the fundamental laws and limitations that govern computations  is not only an inherently rich mathematical subject but one whose conclusions and methodology are increasingly relevant to practical computational problems. Professor Valiant s research is focused on two application areas  machine learning and parallel computation  as well as the core area. A machine that has a learning capability can augment its knowledge by interacting with its environment; no programmer need understand the machine s present  possibly unmanageably complicated state of knowledge. The goals of Professor Valiant s current research are to derive models that capture the phenomenon of learning  particularly the learning of concepts from examples  and to use these models to identify efficient learning algorithms  as well as the ultimate limits to computational learning. For example  in the area of parallel computation  how efficient and easy to program can general purpose machines be made? In this connection  Professor Valiant and his colleagues have obtained some encouraging results concerning the possibility of constructing general-purpose  multiprocessor computers capable of executing parallel algorithms in close to logically optimal time. They are also searching for efficient or optimal parallel algorithms for important computational problems. In the core area of complexity theory  relationships of surprising generality can sometimes be obtained. For example  relationships have been found between the difficulty of finding solutions to combinatorial problems in the case when a unique solution is guaranteed to the more general case when it is not; other work relates the problem of randomly generating one solution  from possibly exponentially many  to the problem of counting these solutions.

Konheim Department of Computer Science University of California at Santa Barbara Telephone: (805) 893-3560 Internet: konheim@cs.ucsb. edu Dr. Konheim received the B.E.E. and M.S. (Mathematics) from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1955 and 1957  respectively. He was awarded the Ph.D. (Mathematics) from Cornell University in 1960. While a Research Staff Member in the Mathematical Sciences Department at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights (1960-82)  he was a visiting Fellow in Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology (1962) and a Senior Fulbright Scholar at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg (1966). Dr. Konheim s professional interests span several areas in Computer Science. His early work at IBM was related to the application of neural-like networks (Perceptrons) to pattern-recognition problems. The analysis of computer algorithms evaluated methods for improving the efficiency of storage schema (hashing  padded lists  sparse tables and disk access). IBM s Liberty Banking Systems included a cryptographic function based on the LUCIFER algorithm developed by his group at the Yorktown Research Center. This work led to the Data Encryption Standard which was evaluated by his Yorktown Probability and Cryptography Group and certified as a National Standard in the 1970 s. Dr. Konheim has spent several summers working for the government in the area of cryptanalysis. In 1970  he began to study the performance of computer communication systems while on sabbatical at the IBM Zurich Laboratory. In connection with the design of IBM s digital PBX  mathematical techniques for modeling loop systems and multiplexing by polling were developed. His current research interests include (i) the effect of interference of virtual circuits in window-based flow control  (ii) the performance of packet-radio networks  (iii) input rate control for B-ISDN  (iv) estimation of rates with heterogeneous ATM traffic at the uni and (v) enhancing the thruput in fast packet switches. Dr. Konheim has held adjunct positions at the Balfour School of Science (Yeshiva University)  CCNY Graduate Center  Courant Institute (New York University)  and The Technion (Israel). He is a member of the MAA  ACM  SIAM and a Senior Member of the IEEE. He is on the editorial board of The Mathematical Scientist and the Telecommunications Research Journal. He is the inventor on four U.S. Patents.

Siegel   On Universal Classes of Extremely Random Constant Time Hash Functions and their Time-space Tradeoff   Apr. 1995 Abstract: A family of functions F that map [0 n]->[0 n]  is said to be h-wise independent if any h points in [0 n] have an image  for randomly selected f in F  that is uniformly distributed. This paper gives both probabilistic and explicit randomized constructions of (n**epsilon)-wise independent functions  for epsilon<1  that can be evaluated in constant time for the standard random access model of computation. Simple extensions give comparable behavior for larger domains. As a consequence  many probabilistic algorithms can for the first time be shown to achieve their expected asymptotic performance for a feasible model of computation. This paper also establishes a tight tradeoff in the number of random seeds that must be precomputed for a random function that runs in time T and is h-wise independent. tr685 A. Siegel   Toward a Usable Theory of Chernoff Bounds for Heterogeneous and Partially Dependent Random Variables   Apr. 1995 Abstract: Let X be a sum of real valued random variables and have a bounded mean E[X]. The generic Chernoff-Hoeffding estimate for large deviations of X is: P{X-E[X]>=a}<=min_{y>=0}exp(-y(a+E[X]))E[exp(y X)]  which applies with a>=0 to random variables with very small tails. At issue is how to use this method to attain sharp and useful estimates. We present a number of Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds for sums of random variables that may have a variety of dependent relationships and that may be heterogeneously distributed. tr686 J. Schmidt  A. Siegel   Double Hashing is Computable and Randomizable with Universal Hash Functions   Apr. 1995 Abstract: Universal hash functions that exhibit (c log n)-wise independence are shown to give a performance in double hashing and virtually any reasonable generalization of double hashing that has an expected probe count of 1/(1-alpha) + epsilon for the insertion of the (alpha n)-th item into a table of size n  for any fixed alpha < 1 and epsilon > 0. This performance is within epsilon of optimal. These results are derived from a novel formulation that overestimates the expected probe count by underestimating the presence of partial items already inserted into the hash table  and from a sharp analysis of the underlying stochastic structures formed by colliding items. tr687 A. Siegel  J. Schmidt   Closed Hashing is Computable and Optimally Randomizable with Universal Hash Functions   Apr. 1995 Abstract: Universal hash functions that exhibit (c log n)-wise independence are shown to give a performance in double hashing  uniform hashing and virtually anyreasonable generalization of double hashing that has an expected probe count of 1/(1-alpha)+O(1/n) for the insertion of the (alpha n)-th item into a table of size n  for any fixed alpha < 1. This performance is optimal. These results are derived from a novel formulation that overestimates the expected probe count by underestimating the presence of local items already inserted into the hash table  and from a very sharp analysis of the underlying stochasticstructures formed by colliding items. Analogous bounds are attained for the expected r-th moment of the probe count  for any fixed r  and linear probing is also shown to achieve a performance with universal hash functions that is equivalent to the fully random case.

Cheatham DIVISION OF APPLIED SCIENCES HARVARD UNIVERSITY Thomas E. Cheatham  Jr. Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science Director of Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science Programming Languages and Environments Professor Cheatham conducts research concerned with understanding  formalizing  and automating the software process and has the long-term goal of dramatically increasing our ability to develop  maintain  and enhance advanced software systems. One of Professor Cheatham s current projects involves the development of a new programming language and support environment. The key feature of this language is its extensibility; it provides for user-defined constructs that permit programming at a very high level and for a range of mechanisms to help in transforming a very high level program into efficient realizations on various target computers. The accompanying programming environment will exploit modern work-stations with large memories  high processing speeds  and high resolution color graphics connected via high bandwidth networks. Professor Cheatham and his colleagues and students have also recently begun work on methods and supporting tools for the implementation of algorithms for massively parallel computers. They are developing a system called H-BSP that is based on the Bulk Synchronous Parallel Model developed by Prof. L. Valiant BSP Page. The goal of a third project is to model many of the communication-intensive activities that take place in a large software project  or any large cooperative enterprise  and to provide computer-based support for the orderly execution of these activities.

The title of his thesis was  Universal Subgoaling  and his thesis advisor was Allen Newell. Before joining the faculty at the University of Michigan  Dr. Laird was a member of research staff at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center from 1984 to 1986. Prof. Laird is currently the director of the University of Michigan s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Research Activities: Prof. Laird s primary research interests are in the nature of the architecture underlying artificial and natural intelligence. Since 1981  his work has centered on the development and use of Soar  a general cognitive architecture. Over the years  this has led to research in both AI and cognitive science. Within AI his work has included research in general problem solving  the genesis of the weak methods  the origins of subgoals  general learning mechanism  interacting with external environments  learning by experience and by instruction  and integrating reactivity  planning  and learning  all in the service of constructing complete autonomous intelligent agents. Within cognitive science  his research has concentrated on detailed modeling of human behavior (reaction times and error rates) in visual attention and concept acquisition. Prof. Laird is currently working on the construction of intelligent agents that interact with dynamic environments. This work is currently being pursued within the context of the Soar/IFOR component of the WISSARD/IFOR project (funded by ARPA/ASTO). The goal of Soar/IFOR is the development of autonomous computer agents whose behavior is tactically indistinguishable from humans. These synthetic agents must not only be lifelike  they must be humanlike with many of the capabilities we commonly associate with intelligent human behavior: real-time reactivity  goal-directed problem solving and planning  large bodies of knowledge  adaptation to changing situations  and interaction and coordination with other intelligent entities. The Soar/IFOR consortium  involving the University of Michigan  University of Southern California s Information Sciences Institute  and Carnegie Mellon University   is developing such agents for air missions: air to air combat  air to ground attacks  helicopter missions. A long term goal of this research is to extend this technology to education  training  and entertainment where humans can interact with humanlike intelligent agents in a variety of synthetic environments. Teaching Activities: EECS 492: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence. EECS 545: Machine Learning. EECS 547: Cognitive Architecture. EECS 592: Advanced Artificial Intelligence. Professional Activities: Prof. Laird has been actively involved in national activities in artificial intelligence. He has been general chair of the Machine Learning Conference  and has served on the program committees of AAAI and IJCAI. In 1994  he was area chair of AAAI in Agents and Architectures as well as being video co-chair. He is a member of AAAI  the Cognitive Science Society  and the American Psychological Society.

Research Interests Current research interests include visual languages and parallel computer architectures. My current visual programming research centers on Ludwig2  a language for data structure manipulation based on graph grammars. Here s the HTML version of the most recent paper  presented at the 1995 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages. Personal Interests Some of my personal interests are hunting and fishing  rebuilding Dodge musclecars  building model rockets  and practicing martial arts.

Rather than try to #ifdef them  I m just going to leave both my 1.1.2 and my new 1.1.3 distributions available for a while. Unless somebody needs an a.out version of the new driver  I ll just put the ELF version out. If you re running Linux 1.2.11 you need the 1.1.2 version; if you re running 2.0.0 you need the 1.1.3 version; if you re running 1.2.12 or 1.2.13 I suspect you probably need the 1.1.2 version; if you re running something from 1.3 you re on your own! In order to obtain the distribution  download either the 1.1.2 a.out  the 1.1.2 ELF  or the 1.1.3 version  gunzip it  untar it  and follow the directions in the README file.

My most recent interests are in the foundations of group-based programming and its application to distributed computing architectures different than a collection of asynchronous workstations running on local area networks of workstations. I m affiliated with the following research projects: The Nile Project that has to do with distributed computing for high-energy physicists. Our goal is to provide a deep hierarchical storage system and a distributed runtime environment for very long-running jobs. My main focus on this project is the distributed application management issues: I d like to be able to have the system adapt to changes in resources  communication platforms  internet connections and internet charges without having to rewrite the system or the applications running on the system. The Team Project that is building distributed computing platforms for both hard and soft-real-time systems. My main focus has been on providing the runtime environment to make fault-tolerant hard real-time computing available to inexpensive platforms. Some things that I m working on with students and ex-students: The message logging approach to making services tolerate crash and communication failures  with Lorenzo Alvisi. We ve come up with a simple and expressive way to characterize the approach and have derived practical and optimal protocols for both message passing and distributed shared memory architectures. A paper describing the approach can be found here and a paper giving a set of protocols (with a comparison to Manetho) can be found here. Group programming in a hard real-time environment  with Matthew Clegg. We ve combined some of the schedulability work done for uniprocessors with the process group abstraction for distributed systems to come up with a system that can tolerate timing  crash and communication failures while still meeting hard real-time deadlines. One of the problems in such systems  of course  is clock synchronization. A paper that describes how we do this can be found here. Failure models  with Laura Sabel. We ve taken apart some of the group membership protocols to better understand what are the lower bounds are for several of the properties that are commonly provided. One way to think of this work is that we re looking at failure detectors that are stronger than a Perfect Failure Detector and at approximations of such failure detectors that are implementable. If you re interested in failure detectors in general  you might take a look at a WWW page that compiles papers on the topic. Comparison of fault-tolerance techniques with Jeremy Sussman. The goal here is to understand what are the intrinsic benefits of a given fault-tolerance paradigm  such as the primary-backup approach  coordinatory-cohort  or active replication.

In my previous life at Stanford  I developed an optimizing compiler for the pure object-oriented language Self which removed a large part of the overhead traditionally associated with message passing. The resulting Self system outperforms comparable systems (such as commercial Smalltalk implementations) by a factor of two to three on some medium-sized (500-line) benchmarks. A second aspect of that project was to integrate optimizing compilation into an interactive programming environment by developing techniques to avoid long compilation pauses and to allow source-level debugging of optimized code. I m interested in many aspects of language implementation  such as compiler optimizations to eliminate message sends (profile-based compiler optimizations  type inference  etc.)  efficient dispatch techniques for statically- and dynamically-typed languages  compiler support for garbage collection ( garbage prevention is better than garbage collection )  measurements and analyses of the execution characteristics of (optimized) object-oriented programs  for example  their instruction mix  cache performance etc.  and software engineering related aspects of object-oriented programming  such as profilers and debuggers for OO programs. Current projects include optimizing compilers or runtime systems for Self  C++  and Java. Check out the publications page if you re interested in more details. Some of my research results have recently been incorporated into Animorphic Systems  Smalltalk and Java Virtual Machines.

Areas of Interest Performance Evaluation and Design of Systems and Architectures Effective Computations and Communications on Networks of Workstations Monitoring and Visualization Tools for Parallel Systems Scientific and Numerical Computations Summary of Research My recent research interests mainly focus on three areas: parallel/distributed computing  software tool/environment development  and scientific computing. I and my colleagues in the High Performance and Software Lab are investigating several research and technical issues into performance evaluation and system support of heterogeneous networks of workstations (NOW). We concentrate on three problem areas: 1) developing performance metrics and providing insights into special natures of heterogeneous distributed computing; 2) providing system support to effectively manage heterogeneity and scheduling computation tasks across networks; 3) building software tool and environment to aid parallel and distributed computing and performance evaluation. Our studies on parallel systems also include several topics of shared-memory and data-parallel computing. Our system research is motivated and driven by our studies of large-scale scientific applications  such as numerical simulations  nonlinear optimizations and image processing.

We have constructed two generations of hardware an 8-processor  bus-based system in the 1980s and a 16-processor  16-memory module system in the 90s. Both systems have hardware support for fetch-and-add  our coordination primitive. The newer system contains full-custom switches of our own design that combine simultaneous references to the same memory address  thereby avoiding one important class of hot spot contention problems. We have a very highly parallel operating system Symunix running on both systems. I was born 2 August 1945 in Queens NYC to Frances and Irving Gottlieb. When I was five  my family moved to a NYC surburb called Elmont  Long Island where I attended the public schools through high school. I went to MIT as an undergraduate and Brandeis as a graduate student. All my degrees are in mathematics. My introduction to computers (specifially an IBM 650 and a Bendix G15) occured during high school when I attended the Columbia University Science Honors Program on Saturdays. My beautiful wife Alice is an associate medical director at Hoffman-LaRoche. She obtained a Ph.D. in immunology from Rockefeller University  an M.D. from Cornell Medical School  and medical subspeciality degrees from N.Y. Hospital and the Hospital for Special Surgery. My two active boys  David and Michael  are in middle school and fourth grade respectively (1994-95). I hope to have a family photo available soon.',\n",

Recent Courses: CIS 6930/CIS 4930 Cryptology (Fall 96) CEN6505 Computer Communication Networks (Fall 96) COP 4600 Operating Systems (Spring 96) CEN4500C Fundamentals of Computer Networks (Spring 96) CIS 6930/CIS 4930 Computer and Network Security (Fall 95) COT 6315 Formal Languages and Theory of Computation (Spring 95) My office hours are MW 2:00-4:00 pm. My spring 1996 schedule is also available. I am the Associate Director for Digital Signal Handling and Satellite Networking in the NASA-sponsored Space Communication Technology Center. I  Dr. Chow and several students are engaged in characterization of errors and error correction methods on satellite channels  especially those using the Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS). We meet Thursdays at 10:30 in CSE-319. I am also a researcher in the Software Engineering Research Center (SERC)  headquartered at Purdue University. I have worked with Prasun Dewan (at UNC Chapel Hill ) on supporting distributed collaboration for software engineering. Several students and I are working on DCS v2 (Distributed Conferencing System  version 2) and we meet T at 11:00 in CSE-344. Here I am with Jayne Valenti Miller  the SERC research coordinator  and Johna Johnson  editor for Data Communications  in New York City on a recent trip for SERC. On campus  I serve on the Council on Information Technologies and Services (CITS) and chair the Networking and Telecommunication Standing Committee ( NTSC ) of CITS. The NTSC provides advice and suggests policy to CITS  which reports to the provost. In the community  I volunteer with the Copeland Community Organic Farm  and have designed a deck and ramp for the end of their semi trailer that I hope to build (with much help - interested? - write me! ) this fall.

M.Sc.  B.Ed. (Sask)  Ph.D. (Waterloo) I am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan . My area of academic research is ``uncertainty in artificial intelligence  . For more than a decade  I have been interested in the application of probability theory to problems in Artificial Intelligence traditionally handled by logics  grammars and heuristics. In AI s earliest days  it was widely held that complexity problems and the unavailability of meaningful probability distributions made this impractical. In the last decade  this opinion has changed. Two major international conferences  one organized by the Association for Uncertainty in AI and one organized by the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Statistics   discuss probabilistic and statistical AI  and statistical approaches to AI problems have entered the AI mainstream. Together with colleagues and students  I have looked at probabilistic approaches to default inference  diagnosis  temporal reasoning  natural language  and classification. My work appears in major journals and several national and international workshops and conferences. I have also edited a special issue of Computational Intelligence journal on the philosophy of nonmonotonic reasoning  featuring a target article by Henry E. Kyburg  Jr. .

My research is strongly interdisciplinary. It concerns using neural networks as a computational model applied to problems in cognitive science and artificial intelligence  engineering and biology. I have had success using them for such disparate tasks as modeling how children acquire words  studying how lobsters chew  and nonlinear data compression. I was Program Chair for the 1996 Cognitive Science Conference. Check the home page for details.

My interests lie in the area of natural language processing and in particular  natural language generation. We are currently working in three main areas. The first  summary generation  involves the generation of natural language text  or summaries  from data such as stock market statistics. We are also investigating text summarization by integrating our work on summary generation with a text interpretation system. In the second  statistical natural language  we are using statistical analysis of large text corpora to identify constraints on how words are used. Such results can be used to automate the development of a lexicon  or dictionary. Finally  we are also working on the generation of multimedia explanation  developing techniques to coordinate language and graphics  to produce explanations in the context of a human computer interface for medical information. Part of our interest here is on the generation of spoken language and differences with generation of text.

Keck Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Southern California  where he is a member of the Departments of Pyschology  Computer Science  and Neuroscience and Head of the Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience Program. Professor Biederman has proposed a theory of real- time human object recognition that posits that objects and scenes are represented as an arrangement of simple volumetric primitives   termed geons. This theory has undergone extensive assessment in psychophysical experiments. Recently  he has employed a neural network model to provide a more biologically based version of the geon assemblage theory which is currently undergoing tests through single unit recording experiment in monkeys  fMRI  and the study of the impairment of object recognition in patients with a variety of neurological symptoms.

Check out the Computational Geometry Impact Task Force s report   Application Challenges to Computational Geometry   also as postscript and compressed postscript  and dvi (or  anon ftp to graphics.lcs.mit.edu  then cd pub  get taskforce.ps.Z). From 1993-94  I was a postdoc in computer graphics and computational geometry at Princeton  working with Pat Hanrahan  Michael Cohen  David Dobkin  and Bernard Chazelle. The year before that  I postdoc ed at the Hebrew University Givat Ram campus in Jerusalem. From 1987-92  I was at UC Berkeley  completing a dissertation with Carlo Sequin. My research interests include global illumination algorithms; visibility computations; constrained spatial subdivisions; visual simulation; interactive algorithm visualization  verification and animation; self-checking geometric algorithms; real-time ray-traced imagery; and machine vision  including fully automated acquisition of geometric models and other forms of data. I head the Synthetic Imagery Group  which is part of the MIT Computer Graphics Group. Our main research emphases are 1) digitizing whole cities with pose-instrumented (6-DOF) digital cameras; 2) managing and rendering extremely complex geometric datasets; 3) generating real-time ray-traced imagery on general-purpose (i.e.  non-graphics) hardware; and 4) techniques for remote  interactive  collaborative undergraduate education. Also  Julie Dorsey has recently joined the Dept. of Architecture and Lab for Computer Science at MIT  and is building the Visual Simulation Group. This semester (Fall 1996)  I m teaching 6.837 (Introduction to Computer Graphics)  which will meet TR from 230-4pm in MIT building/room 3-270. Spring 1996  I taught 6.046 (Introduction to Algorithms)  which met TR from 230-4pm in MIT building/room 2-190. Fall 1995  I taught 6.837 (Introduction to Computer Graphics)  formerly 6.037 (it was renumbered to reflect the fact that graduate students can now take it for  G  credit). The course met MWF from 1-2pm in MIT building/room E25-111. When the ground isn t completely frozen (and  starting winter 1996  even when it is)  I play ultimate frisbee. I also like to bowl; my lifetime high score is 251. Finally  I enjoy shrinking my friends (like Rob Myers) -- no computers were used to make this picture! here to see some recent publications (with color figures!)  including Ph.D. thesis and Siggraph papers (please let me know if these are not previewable or printable at your site); here for some useful computational geometry and graphics codes; here for some large and/or interesting geometric datasets  including the Berkeley Soda Hall model. Ouch! hits.',\n",

Klavans  Ph.D. Director  Center for Research on Information Access Research Interests My research lies in computational linguistics and natural language processing. I am currently working on ways to represent meaning from texts and to link meaningful segments via semantic nets. I have been involved in the Text Encoding Initiative  an SGML based set of guidelines for indepth text representation  which has led me to be interested in mark-up languages in general. I am also working on ways to automatically determine lexical information via statistical means over parsed texts. Prior to arriving at Columbia  I spent nearly ten years at the TJ Waston IBM Research Division  where I worked on extracting information from machine-readable dictionaries. I have also worked on speech synthesis and text-to-speech systems. The kinds of systems that have used the results of my research have been: natural language parsers  machine translation systems  and text critiquing systems.

(Queen s)  M.Sc.  Ph.D. (Toronto) I am a faculty member at the University of Saskatchewan  where I teach and do research in computer systems in the Department of Computer Science. I am the Department s Graduate Chair for 1996/97. More information about our graduate program is available from the Department s Home Page. Please direct all graduate program inquiries to the Department s Graduate Secretary. In broad terms  my research relates to computer systems design and performance evaluation  with a particular focus on operating systems  distributed systems  and computer networks. Details of specific research projects are given below. I collaborate in these areas with researchers at Saskatchewan and elsewhere  including TRLabs  IBM Canada s Centre for Advanced Studies in Toronto  and Hewlett-Packard. Classes for 1996/97 I am teaching three classes this year: Fall Term: CMPT 215.3 Introduction to Computer Organization and Architecture CMPT 815.3 Computer Systems and Performance Evaluation Spring Term: (We have no winter term in Saskatchewan) CMPT 115.3 Principles of Computer Science Research Projects At the U of S  my research activities are rooted in the DISCUS Research Group  a group we (Derek Eager  Carey Williamson  and I) formed to consolidate our common research interests in the performance of distributed computing environments. Along with my graduate students  I am presently engaged in a variety of projects  including: system and networking issues in mobile computing multi-level file caching in client/server environments performance issues in OSF DCE (as part of the MANDAS project in collaboration with IBM Canada and colleagues at five other universities) network management in ATM networks. Recent papers in these and other areas are available from the DISCUS ftp server  along with completed theses of recent students. Other University and Professional Activities I sit as a Council member in the College of Graduate Studies and Research and am a member of the Board of Directors of the University of Saskatchewan Faculty Club. I am also active within ACM SIGMETRICS  the special interest group for performance measurement and modelling. Other Interests My head may belong to the University of Saskatchewan  but my heart is with the Saskatchewan Roughriders (the 1989 Grey Cup champs and hosts of the hugely successful 1995 Grey Cup)  the Toronto Blue Jays (the 1992 & 1993 World Series champs)  and the Boston Bruins (soon to be Stanley Cup champs again). I also play third base for the 1994 & 1995 league and tournament champion Black Velvet Bandits of the University of Saskatchewan Fastball League. And  of course  the U of S Huskies  the 1990 Vanier Cup Champions  will get their licks in  96.

Len Schubert s research interests center around language  knowledge representation  inference and planning. A unifying theme is the development of foundations for general  extensible story understanding and conversational systems. This has led to the development of strategies for human-like  error-tolerant parsing  and of increasingly expressive logics for capturing the content of natural language utterances in all their richness. The most recently developed representation  episodic logic (EL)  associates episodes with sentences and allows for adjective/adverb-like predicate modifiers  property/proposition-forming operators  and other language-like constructs  simplifying the process of mapping from language to the meaning representation. The theoretical investigation of natural language processing and knowledge representation has been accompanied by the development of implemented systems intended to support language understanding  reasoning and planning. This work has focused on probabilistic input-chaining and goal-chaining strategies for plausible inference in EL  on concept- and topic-centered strategies for access to relevant information  and on provably efficient ``specialists   that accelerate inference about time relationships  taxonomies  parts  colors  numbers  and sets. The most recent implemented system called EPILOG incorporates all of these functions and effectively answers questions posed in EL (with output in English)  using general world knowledge about things  people  events  actions  and causes. Schubert also collaborates with James Allen on the TRAINS project  aimed at building a conversationally proficient interactive planning assistant in a dynamic world. This has provided both a context for some of the above work on language processing  and an impetus for recent work on ``scalable   temporal reasoning  and on a new approach to the frame problem in planning  called ``explanation closure.

He addresses issues of proper modeling tools  such as appropriate mathematical forms and data structures as they apply to particular industrial problems. In addition to determining appropriate mathematical forms  considerations are given to areas of computational geometry such as 3-D triangulation schemes and 3-D convex hull algorithms. His approach to applied problems is an engineering one  utilizing existing techniques when they work and development of new techniques when needed.  The desired end-product is a model that works  as opposed to a description of a new algorithm and how it compares to existing ones.  On the theoretical side  he focuses on issues of curves and surface design. He is interested in the notion of shape and how to model it using discrete curves and surfaces. This work is motivated by the lack of sufficient attention given to shape considerations by most of the major software packages used in surface and solid design. Faculty and Their Research',\n",

Recently  I have been working on constraint-based program analysis algorithms  including constraint theories  complexity  algorithms  and implementation issues. A demonstration constraint-based type inference system  Illyria  is available. I m also interesed in so-called  end user programming   or how to make programming accessible to non-programmers. Toward this end  I m involved in developing two special purpose languages: Tioga  a database visualization system that makes it easy for people without visualization expertise to turn relational data into pictures  and TREE  a project to make conversion between data formats simple without the use of arcane sed  awk  and perl scripts.

Kung Gordon McKay Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Division of Applied Sciences Harvard University COMPUTER NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS Professor Kung teaches courses in computer science and communications systems and leads a research team in these areas. Prior to joining Harvard in 1992  Dr. Kung was on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for 17 years. He designed and built several high-speed computers and networks. Dr. Kung s current research is directed toward the design of high-speed computer and communications networks. At Harvard his research team has developed with its industrial partner an experimental ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) switch with 622 megabits per second ports. Five copies of the switch have been build. Design and experiment of new protocols and applications are being conducted on networks based on this switch. See project descriptions here and there  and performance traces measured on the switch here. In connection with a project course  the team has also developed a radio-based mobile Internet system capable of providing secure short-cut routing. Complementary to his academic activities  Dr. Kung maintains a strong linkage with industry. He has taken several leaves from his university positions to work with companies. Professor Kung is Conference Chair for the Harvard Conference on the Internet and Society to be held in May 28-31  1996. See here for Information about Applying for Harvard Graduate Admissions.

Hi! I am a Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers  The State University of New Jersey  having joined the faculty in 1982. My current research interests include: compile-time program analyses and software tools for parallel/sequential programming environments. In July 1995  I was elected Chair of ACM_SIGPLAN and have been quite active in the SIGPLAN community  having served on the SIGPLAN Executive Committee for 8 years. Currently  I also serve on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Programming Languages  and on the Advisory Board of the Douglass Project for Rutgers Women in Science  Math and Engineering. My research group is informally referred to as PROLANGS  the PROgramming LANGuageS research group. We have a weekly lunch and a weekly reading group meeting  on Thursday afternoons from 3:00-5:00 pm in CoRE Conference Room B  to present and discuss interesting conference and journal papers  and sometimes to practice our research talks. We are the sole Rutgers DCS group with our own logo  on t-shirts and sweatshirts  and lots of esprit d corps! My current major NSF grant involves collaborative research with Dr. Bill Landi of Siemens Corporate Research. We are investigating how to scale compile-time analyses to  industrial-strength  programs of 100 000 lines of code. The home page for 198:314 this fall  which I am teaching with Armin Haken and Phil Stocks  will list all information and assignments distributed in the course. We may list homework answers etc. here as well. I am team teaching a new version of our Programming Languages and Compilers II course with Prof Uli Kremer next semester. We are changing the course to emphasize the building of an optimizing compiler for an imperative programming language  with lecture exploration of non-imperative paradigms as well. Syllabi for courses I taught in 1995-96: 198:314 Principles of Programming Languages  198:515 Programming Languages and Compilers I  198:516 Programming Languages and Compilers II  I recently participated in the ACM Workshop on Strategic Directions in Computing Research  in the Programming Languages - Program Analysis subgroup. My position paper poses some important questions about the future of program analysis.

Caltech  1956 M.S. Caltech  1957 Ph.D. Caltech  1960 Our laboratory is dedicated to the creation of silicon models of specific areas of the nervous system. The rapid development of the Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit technology has given us a medium in which it is currently possible to fabricate tens of millions of transistors interconnected on a single silicon wafer. Silicon is thus a medium in which structures of high complexity can be created. Early experiments have shown that the elementary operations found in the nervous system can also be realized by analog circuits created with standard silicon fabrication technology. Many neural areas are organized as thin sheets  and carry two-dimensional representations of their computational space. These structures map well onto the two-dimensional silicon surface. In both neural and silicon technologies  the active devices (synapses and transistors) occupy no more than one or two percent of the space --  wire  fills the entire remaining space. The limitation of connectivity in nervous tissue has clearly forced the computational structure into a particular form. If the required functions could be implemented with less wire  nature would have evolved superior creatures with more computations per unit brain area. The resulting optimization provides strong guidelines for the design of homologous silicon structures.',\n",

Both we and our machines must be able to take account of uncertainty  for reasoning  for planning  in knowledge representation. Dealing with uncertainty raises a number of fundamental questions: How do you best represent uncertainty in a formal framework? Various suggestions have been made; it is turning out to be the case that most are reducible to probabilistic measures. Is probability objective or subjective? Purely subjective views of probability are of questionable use; but objective logical views are not yet well developed. That is a task we are currently working on. Not only do we want to represent uncertainty in a fixed body of knowledge  but we want to use new evidence to update those probabilities. Various updating procedures have been proposed. Analysis reveals that they have much in common  but efficient updating is still a goal we are working on. Finally  the reason for the intelligent use of uncertainty is for making decisions. But the appropriate decision theory depends on the treatment of uncertainty  and so is also an active area of research. Click here for my research group s home page. Recent Publications Kyburg  H.

Assistant Professor (87-88)  Columbia University. Assistant Professor (89-92)  Associate Professor (92-present); University of Rochester. Presidential Young Investigator (89-95). Professor Lane Hemaspaandra s research area is computational complexity theory. In computational complexity theory  the various tasks with which computers may be faced are divided into groups -- known as complexity classes -- according to the types of computational power and the computational models they use. The relative power of those classes is then studied  with the goal of discovering the weakest level of computational power that suffices to solve the crucial problems posed to computers today. Professor Hemaspaandra s particular interests include the power of counting-based computation  the power of probabilistic computation  the power of unambiguous computation  the importance of query order when accessing databases  the study of efficient algorithms for complex sets  and complexity-theoretic aspects of security  fault-tolerance  data compression  and political science.

Some of this research involves computational modeling of the  connectionist  or  neural network  type. The goal of this work is a theory of language comprehension that accounts for detailed aspects of skilled performance  and can be related to the types of linguistic impairments that are observed both developmentally and as a consequence of brain injury.

I find designing new network systems and studying their performance  as well as improving the performance of existing systems  very exciting. My research in telecommunication networks has resulted in techniques which will make networks more efficient. More people will have access  and fewer will get a busy signal due to telephone network overloads. If there is a heavy overload  as on the famous Mother s Day peak  the new protocols will reduce congestion. Hospital networks for medical data and digital X-rays are starting to exist and will help patients and physicians have faster access to medical information. I have been involved in evaluating the performance of standards for such medical communication networks. Currently  I am exploring new approaches for fast and economical multicast routing schemes for multi media transmission in the ATM environment  especially for multicast interactive sessions with large groups over wide area networks (internet). I enjoy working with students and helping them. I find discussions with students very exciting and motivating. Selected Publications MAYDELL  U.M. (with C.

From 1992-1996  she was a research scientist in the Computer Science Department at Rice University. She has just joined the faculty in the Computer Science Department at the University of Rochester as an assistant professor. Her research interests include parallel and distributed computing  computer architecture  networks  simulation methodology  and performance evaluation. In particular  she is interested in compiler and runtime support for parallelism  and parallel applications research. As a graduate student  she developed an efficient execution-driven technique for the simulation of shared-memory multiprocessors. This technique was implemented as part of the Rice Parallel Processing Testbed (RPPT). She used this tool to design and evaluate synchronization support  adaptive caching techniques  and the use of relaxed consistency models for a hierarchical bus-based shared-memory architecture. These results contributed to the design of the Willow multiprocessor architecture. This work also lead to a classification of memory consistency models that  in addition to unifying all existing models into a common framework  provides insight into the implications of these models with respect to access ordering. She is currently involved in the design and implementation of TreadMarks  a software distributed shared memory system running on a network of workstations. She is developing compiler-runtime integration techniques for improved performance. She has also worked with Alejandro Schaffer on FASTLINK  a project to provide fast sequential and parallel genetic linkage analysis software.

His thesis research was on the design and use of a demand-driven term-based communication system. For more information  check out my curriculum vitae. Teaching I m teaching two courses this term: CS4  a survey course intended for nonmajors and CS68  a majors-only course on programming languages. I ve taught a number of courses at Dartmouth College and The University of Chicago  including introductory calculus  introductory programming (parts 1 and 2)  undergraduate programming langauges  graduate programming languages  computer science for nonmajors  undergraduate operating systems and undergraduate networking. I also teach the occasional continuing education course  often on subjects pertaining to electronic publishing. These days  I ve been teaching HTML to a number of groups  and therefore maintain a rough collection of online HTML references. I m also starting to teach JavaScript to a number of people (primarily in preparation for using it in our nonmajors course) and have created some JavaScript reference materials and examples. Fun I ll admit that most of my free time is spent with my wife and new son (born July 31  1996) On a completely separate note  also maintain the Jonathan Richman FAQ  but I haven t had a lot of time for that in recent months. I also waste my free time collecting music (my tastes vary -- roots rock  singer-songwriters  power pop  great Boston bands  ...). One great place to look for independent music on the net is the Indie Ocean  and I m not saying that just because they bribed me to. They carry lots of great Boston-based musicians  like Barrence Whitfield and Robin Lane. Disclaimer This is not a fancy page (but you could tell that). This is because I am a strong proponent of logical markup  rather than physical markup. That is  I believe most HTML authors should place emphasis on indicating the role of each piece of text  rather than the appearance of that text.

Research Interests Distributed Systems Distributed problem solvers investigations involve multiple client-server models using: 1) direct RPC (via protocol compilation) 2) Java and 3) Tcl-DP. Comparative studies represent an unachieved goal. Modeling and Simulation studies are underway. Neural Network Processors Current neural network research activities include: combining ANN s and expert systems into mixed problem solving systems in a Cooperative Heterogeneous Intelligent Processor System (CHIPs)  and application of ANN s  general simulation  and expert system tools to problem solving in  real  (human) and robotic behavior. Simulation Processors and Environments Our BEAK model of a SimEnvironment (Build  Exercise  Analyse  Knowledge) includes work such as: B-unit activites are a logic-based processor for reasoning about simulation software and natural language input in the model building process. E-unit activites center on discrete-event or combined continuous and discrete systems  object-oriented systems and packages  and incorporation of ES elements which forge an eventual  combined continuous discrete and symbolic  simulator. A-unit activites primarily involve animation and general purpose statistical approaches. K-unit activites include a  model base  which incorporates general knowledge about simulation and systems to be modeled and results. Applications include computer communication (network) systems and human behavior models.

Stolfo Department of Computer Science  Columbia University  New York  NY 10027 sal@cs.columbia.edu Member of the Polytechnic University Center for Advanced Technology A Puzzle to Ponder Can you guess what the image means? (Keep browsing for the answer.) By the way  the topic of this page is constantly under development until that ultimate day...... Past Research Interests and Activities: Learning Problem-solving Heuristics My thesis Research (1976-1979  See IJCAI 1979) The Massively Parallel Dado Machine(~1979-~1989) Hardware Software Patents Current status: DADO was licensed to a company and abruptly left academia for its obvious commercialization. See The San Francisco Examiner article on page A-1 of the Feb. 5  1996 issue (click on Previous Examiners button) for some information about its current status. The final chapter on DADO has not yet been written! Stay tuned! Deductive and Expert Databases ACE - The First Deductive (Expert) Database System (1980 - ~1982) Active/Deductive Database System Reorganization and  Predictive  Load Balancing (1990 - ~1994) The PARADISER system (1990-~1994) Parallel Rule-based Systems (Then and Now) (1980 - ~1994) Incremental Rule Processing in Parallel Environments (1990 - ~1994)  Real-world  Application Studies ALEXSYS - Mortgage-backed Security Trading in Parallel. (1988 - ~1990) Sponsors: (D)ARPA Office of Naval Research New York State Science and Technology Foundation CAT Program Citicorp Intel IBM Current Interests: Parallel/Distributed Intelligent Systems (1990 s - ) KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY in DATABASE and DATA MINING (KDD/DM) My former days of expert systems research  and parallel hardware design and implementation were great fun. But now I am specializing in parallel/distributed processing for Machine Learning (or alternatively click here)  Intelligent Information Systems  Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining  Financial Systems Computing  and Active Databases. Check out upcoming events like KDD96  or AAAI96 (I m on the PC of both) and journal sources like Kluwer s journals in this area. I am a member of the editorial board of the Journal on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. Please take a look at our Call for Papers. See also the page on the Parallel and Distributed Intelligent Systems Lab for a more thorough treatment of my current research activities and relationship to industrial users. MERGE-PURGE: Intelligently Integrating Heterogenous Databases Although the term merge/purge is used by our Citicorp collaborators and other commercial organizations  it is probably better termed The Data Scrubbing  or Data Cleaning Problem. (That s a term Mike Stonebraker used to describe this problem--and Stonebraker-terminology is almost always colorful and illuminating.) Our most recent success on data supplied by the Child Welfare Department of the State of Washington is memoralized in the letter viewable by clicking here. META-LEARNING for Scalable Data Mining Meta-learning is a term we coined for an approach gaining in popularity in the DM/KDD community these days. The essential idea is to combine a number of separately learned classifiers or models in such a fashion that machine learning can be scaled to large (and inherently distributed) databases  and (ideally) accuracy can be boosted. But how does one combine separately learned classifiers? We consider that question as a learning problem and apply machine learning algorithms to  meta-learn  how underlying classifiers behave or correlate with eachother. Hmmmmm... ELECTRONIC COMMERCE and FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS: Widely Distributed Data Mining and Fraud Detection My current interest lies in the future of large scale network-based information systems  especially Fraud and Intrusion Detection. We are studying methods to apply learning agents  and Meta-learning agents in WAN financial information systems to learn how to detect fraudlent transactions. This work is directly relevant to Information Warfare problems that will undoubtedly occur in the future. (These problems probably occur today but no one has yet learned how to detect it globally! Stay tuned!) This research is being conducted in collaboration with our friends at the Financial Services Technology Consortium.  Integrating Multiple Models: AAAI96 Workshop Many researchers are working on similar techniques for integrating multiple learned models. So Phil Chan  David Wolpert and myself are organizing a Workshop at AAAI-96 called Integrating Multiple Models for Improving and Scaling Machine Learning. See the workshop agenda and call for papers. Please participate directly if you are interested in pursuing these ideas or if you have new results to share with the community. Speeding Up Monte Carlo Simulations I ve also studied parallelization strategies for Monte Carlo simulations. Check out Dynamic Neighborhood Bounding  a simple heuristic strategy to save on expensive function computations that is also amenable to fast parallel execution. (Follow the link to  papers .) Collaborators Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) I ve been working with the Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) having played some small role in its early formation. The FSTC s  Fraud Project  is the focus of our joint effort. See the description on Fraud and Intrusion Detection in Financial Information Systems using Meta-learning Agents for details about our approach. Citicorp My relationship with Citicorp was established through my consultancies and research relationships with the Citicorp Technology Office. Working with companies like Citicorp is a wonderful opportunity to learn about real-world problems and datasets for use in establishing benchmarks and controlled studies of fundamental technologies. My collaboration with Citicorp and other organizations lead to the development of a number of fundamental technologies that were demonstrated in  real-life  financial applications. Some of these are described in this web page. Seek them out. System Management ARTS SMARTS is a spinoff from the research lab of Professor Yechiam Yemini. Their SOS agent infrastructure is being used in our work on meta-learning agents for fraud and intrusion detection.

The Answer Did you guess what the image means? My Greatest Achievement in Life One last thought (for now). Of all my accomplishments  absolutely none come close to my true achievement in life. Fun at my home town And I especially enjoy doing all sorts of things for my community mostly through my kids  schools. Some of you may even have heard of a special event in Ridgewood  New Jersey where we live. Its called DADS NIGHT. Ridgewood has all sorts of interesting events going on. Another one that I am happy to be involved with is SUPER SCIENCE SATURDAY. Visit the homepages of both for a peek at what s up in Ridgewood!

My research deals with the problems of developing complex database systems. I have concentrated on the specification of database systems and the mechanical reasoning that is required to assure that specifications have their intended properties. Current work involves building the database theory needed in mapping specifications to effective implementations and development of a formally based means of developing flexible concurrency control schemes  the latter in collaboration with Ron Morrison at the University of St Andrews. I have been a bird watcher and naturalist since I was ten years old in West Virginia. I have written a children s book on the Wild Turkey  the bird not the Bourbon  and I occasionally assist Don Kroodsma in ornithological field work. Recently I have been building a database index for the Library of Natural Sounds collection at the Laboratory for Ornithology at Cornell. I am a big fan of Boiled in Lead.',\n",

A major focus of this work is to develop techniques for irregular scientific problems  i.e. problems that are unstructured  sparse adaptive or block structured. This group works extensively with applications scientists in biomedicine  computational chemistry  computational aerospace and computational physics  and with parallel compiler vendors. Many of the concepts first described and prototyped by this project are making their way to High Performance Fortran during the ongoing second round of language definition. This work has also led to the development of runtime support (meta-CHAOS) to couple runtime support libraries used in data and task parallel compilers. Meta-CHAOS is a central component of the Parallel Compiler Runtime Consortium. Currently developing techniques that will allow parallel compute and data servers to offer their services to remote clients. The goal is to develop techniques that will make it possible to compose programs that execute on any combination of distributed memory  shared memory or networked microcomputers or workstations. We are motivating this research by two categories of applications. The first category is sensor data processing and data fusion  and the second category is complex biomedical and physical simulations. We have developed early prototype software able to couple several independent data parallel programs. Our prototypes are able to couple separately executing High Performance FORTRAN programs  and to couple High Performance FORTRAN programs with parallel applications developed using the Maryland CHAOS and Block Parti libraries. This computer science research program has been motivated by collaborations with biomedical  physical and earth scientists. Recent collaborations with biomedical scientists have included work with NIH researchers who focus on problems associated with molecular dynamics  protein folding  and radiation treatment planning. Recent work with physical scientists has included collaborations with researchers investigating computational aerospace  and computational combustion. Current environmental science collaborators are focusing on problems associated with the use of remote sensor data sources to characterize the Earth s land cover and to quantify the earth s carbon balance. I am now expanding my group s research to focus to the application of new ideas in systems software research to problems that arise in clinical settings. In one set of projects  we will develop embedded systems that are able to provide feedback and suggestions on patient care issues by monitoring medical data from a variety of sources (e.g. a Clinical Laboratory database  a Pharmacy database   sources of archived clinical data and the main hospital database). In another set of projects  we will provide software tools that can be used to facilitate large scale epidemiological and health service research studies. We will develop tools for producing large aggregated datasets from multiple data sources. These projects will be built using software developed (or modified) in the course of our ongoing research in distributed computing. Our new clinical projects will  in turn  be fed back into our systems software research to improve the quality and the generality of the tools we build.',\n",

Consider the following realistic possibilities  which are currently the main focus of ongoing work in intelligent systems research around the globe. An intelligent vision system installed in a car tracks the road and wakes up the dozing driver when the car is beginning to to head towards the shoulder. Thousands of lives could be saved annually. Another data-driven system could help to perform precise radioactive therapy on a cancerous tumor in a way that minimizes damage to adjacent cells. An interactive automated system could consider a set of symptoms and warn of a likely heart attack in an emergency room patient. Another medical system can perform sophisticated analysis of a collection of tests  help assess the probability of cancer recurrence and suggest a schedule for repeated evaluations. The basic principle driving these systems is that they can LEARN to function from very large corpuses of data. What makes this technology possible is the remarkable match between the massive amount of information that can be stored on modern computers and the amazing computational capabilities (speed) of these machines. Our society is currently entering a new period where massive amounts of heterogeneous information are generated and stored on computers and are readily available for exploration over academic networks  digital libraries  and commercial information services. At the same time  modern networks of computers can perform billions of computation steps per second. This rather unique match of raw computer power and sea of available information creates many previously unfeasible opportunities for building intelligent systems. Coping with information explosion  scientific data mining  interactive modelling of unstructured data and complex processes  and intelligent data-driven decision-making with uncertainty are among the major current focus areas in computer science. One striking example of the use of this computing power was a recent application developed at Johns Hopkins University. A chess end-game analysis program (designed by Lewis Stiller) running on a 65 536 processor machine and using gigabytes of storage found chess end-games that absolutely require more than 220 moves to win a simple chess game. Chess masters for generations used a rule that declared a draw after only 50 moves. The old rule was dictated by human experience that could not perform this type of analysis. A different program  implemented by an interdisciplinary group of researchers from Astronomy and Computer Science  automatically finds stars  galaxies or filters cosmic rays in images obtained by the Hubble Telescope. This program is using a decision tree induction system implemented by S. Murthy at the Johns Hopkins University. This program is very fast and can easily process millions of astronomical objects in a short amount of time. My current research program focuses on high-performance computer systems and efficient algorithms that provide the computational capabilities to support this critical information technology. Our main focus is the design and analysis of algorithms for high-performance intelligent systems. Specifically  we are interested in efficient parallel and sequential algorithms for modelling and controlling complex processes (e.g.  computer systems or neural networks) -- intelligent information retrieval and modelling of large data depositories (that can be used in educational environments) -- constraint networks and probabilistic networks (that can be used for decision-making with uncertainty  e.g.  medical diagnosis) -- and machine learning. The algorithms designed by our group have been applied to a variety of applications  such as public health  computer vision  computer game playing  astronomy and several biomedical applications.

A short version of this work appeared in the 1995 VLDB Conference in Zurich. The version of this work accepted for publication in the VLDB Journal is in VLDB Journal Article . The hB-Pi tree is insensitive to increase in dimensions. This makes it particularly useful in data warehousing where many different attributes are needed for study of patterns in data. There seems to be a growing interest in this work as multi-dimensional data becomes impossible to store in array form when the number of dimensions and the volume of data is large.

However  I later did my Ph.D. research in the theory of protocol design. For more details  see my vita . For recent papers  click here . My goal is to fruitfully combine my experience in distributed systems  both theory and practice. My most recent work in network protocols includes the first O(log(log(n)) algorithm for fair queuing  new techniques for fragmentation and reassembly  and new load balancing protocols. Recent work in distributed algorithms include a result that shows that crash failures can cause almost all asynchronous protocols to fail (assuming that nodes keep no NVRAM across crashes)  and techniques for making window protocols self-stabilizing. Web pointers to .ps files can be found below. The work on distributed algorithms is supported by an ONR Young Investigator Award and a grant from NSF; the work in network protocols is supported by an NSF Research Initiation Award. Past work on network protocols includes techniques for speeding up packet processing based on adding fields to packets  making hop-by-hop flow control both efficient and reliable  efficient fair queuing using deficit round robin  and efficient timer algorithms. Patents for past work include patents for bridge protocols  switch design  the OSI routing update protocol  and rate based flow control. Past work on distributed algorithms includes (together with colleagues at MIT and Univ of Texas) a set of general techniques to make protocols self-stabilizing. A protocol is self-stabilizing if it begins to work correctly regardless of what state the protocol starts in: thus self-stabilization is an abstraction of a strong fault-tolerance property. Some of the techniques we have discovered (for making protocols self-stabilizing) include local checking and correction  local checking and global correction  compiling synchronous protocol  counter flushing  and window washing. I hope that coupling these two themes (distributed algorithms and network protocols  theory and practice) will provide a rich synergy both in terms of research and coursework. For example  I have taught the network protocol class for senior Wash U undergraduates for three semesters  and have taught them some protocol design techniques. I taught the Distributed Algorithms class in the Spring of 95 and taught a tutorial on applying techniques from distributed algorithms in SIGCOMM 95. I illustrated the theory using many real-world protocol examples. I will teach a tutorial on efficient protocol implementation techniques in SIGCOMM 96.

COURSE OUTLINE FOR CS564T In the spring of 1995  I taught a course on concurrent message passing algorithms  with emphasis on applications to network protocols. The course is designed to help students learn how to design protocols and to apply them to the problems of real networks. Thus we illustrate the main ideas using actual protocols from existing networks. I taught an abbreviated version of that course as a tutorial in SIGCOMM 95.

Allen s Home Page James F. Allen  URCS Faculty Member b. 1950. Ph.D. (1979) University of Toronto.

James Allen s research interests span a range of issues covering natural language understanding  discourse  knowledge representation  common-sense reasoning and planning. These areas of research are combined in the TRAINS project  a long term effort co-directed with Len Schubert. The TRAINS system is an intelligent planning assistant that can converse in spoken natural language with a person to create  discuss and evaluate various plans involving freight shipments by train. In particular  Allen s research breaks down into two main subareas  broadly classified as research in discourse and research in plan reasoning. The research in discourse is focused on two-person extended dialogs in which the speakers have specific tasks to accomplish. An emphasis in this work is the representation and use of the context of the dialog to solve problems in semantic interpretations and the recognition of the intentions underlying the speakers  utterances. Work in this area has included developing the first computational model of speech acts  the development of a multi-level plan-based analysis involving discourse-level plans as well as domain-level plans  and the development of several different discourse-plan recognition algorithms. In addition  we are exploring how prosody and intonation signals discourse intentions and how this interacts with the plan-based dialog model. While it is important for work to be formally well-defined and understood  it is equally important that computational theories can lead to effective implementations. As a result  a considerable amount of effort has also been made in developing an expressive hybrid knowledge representation system that can support complex reasoning about plans and actions. The research in plan reasoning draws much of its motivation from the dialog work. In particular  the representation of plans must support a wide range of different forms of reasoning: plan construction (i.e. traditional planning)  plan recognition  plan evaluation  and the communication of plans between agents. Much of our work in this area has focused on the representation of time and action  and we have reformulated the planning problem as a problem in temporal reasoning. Within this framework  we have developed a representation of plans that is temporally explicit and supports plan construction  recognition and communication. We are also exploring methods of temporal reasoning that are viable even with large data sets of temporal information.

My starting place is the interaction between the intelligent agent and its environment. Goals  choices  and sources of information are all defined in terms of this interaction. In some sense it is the only thing that is real  and from it all our sense of the world is created. How is this done? How can interaction lead to better behavior  better perception  better models of the world? What are the computational issues in doing this efficiently and in realtime? These are the sort of questions that I ask in trying to understand what it means to be intelligent  to predict and influence the world  to learn  perceive  act  and think.',\n",

Randomization plays a role in each area. A major recent result  obtained in collaboration with Lance Fortnow  our former graduate students Carsten Lund (Ph.D.  91) and Mario Szegedy (Ph.D.  89)  and Leonid Levin of Boston University  is the invention of  transparent proofs   proofs one can verify by a small number of spotchecks. We have shown that all formal mathematical proofs can be transformed into transparent form. The result and its subsequent refinements have found applications in areas as seemingly remote as approximate discrete optimization (e.g.  nearly optimal traveling salesman routing). In joint work with graduate student Bob Beals (Ph.D.  93)  we have found Monte Carlo algorithms with guaranteed performance bounds to find structural elements of matrix groups (given by a list of generators). The work involves methods from group theory  combinatorics  and probability theory (Markov chains). I have been studying group actions on graphs. A recent result provides an asymptotic classification of finite vertex-symmetric graphs with an excluded minor  using connections to hyperbolic geometry. Back to faculty interests home page.

Society increasingly relies on complex computerized systems to accomplish basic daily functioning. This reliance demands that computer systems be built that can continue to operate even when one or more hardware modules and/or software programs malfunction. A central theme of Dr. Sullivan s research is designing systems that can tolerate faults. With his colleagues  Dr. Sullivan has defined and analyzed novel probabilistic models of self-monitoring multiprocessor systems and provided powerful diagnostic strategies for localizing and removing faults. He and Prof. Masson have also introduced a promising software fault tolerance technique called the certification trail method. Dr. Sullivan s research interests also include the broad area of the design and analysis of algorithms  e.g.  algorithms motivated by artificial intelligence applications.

My research centers around intelligent coordination among multiple (semi-)autonomous systems  involving the proactive selection (planning) of physical/communicative/computational actions that improve performance in a multiagent context. My work thus is concerned with how artificial agents should decide what courses of action to commit to given a multiagent world  how they should meet those commitments (including meeting real-time constraints)  and how they should revise and renegotiate their commitments based on unexpected events in their environment. The projects/groups that I am involved in include: The Michigan DIAG (Distributed Intelligent Agents Group) The UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicles) Project  part of the ARPA Real-Time Planning and Control Initiative SSA: Ship System Automation CIRCA: The Cooperative Intelligent Real-Time Control Architecture UMDL: The University of Michigan Digital Library project CREW: The Collaboratory for Research in Electronic Work An Agent-Based Architecture for Distributed Configuration Design Our multiagent simulation testbed  MICE  is available via anonymous ftp  and some of my papers are available in compressed postscript format.

His PhD research developed an approach for planning coordinated actions and interactions in a network of distributed AI problem-solving systems. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan  where his interests are in distributed artificial intelligence  planning  blackboard systems  and real-time problem solving. He has published extensively in these areas  and is author of the book Coordination of Distributed Problem Solvers (Kluwer Academic Press). In his most recent work  he has been designing a framework for coordination based on hierarchical  multi-dimensional behavior specifications  and he has been developing an integrating architecture for combining real-time and intelligent systems. He is a 1991 recipient of a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National Science Foundation. Prior to joining the faculty at the University of Michigan in 1988  he was a Research Computer Scientist in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Massachusetts. He is an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Systems  Man  and Cybernetics  and has served on a number of conference and workshop program committees  including co-chairing the 1992 Distributed AI Workshop.

Abu-Mostafa Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. B.Sc. 1979  Cairo University; M.S.E.E. 1981  Georgia Institute of Technology; Ph.D. 1983  California Institute of Technology. The Learning Systems group at Caltech works on the theory  implementation  and application of automated learning  pattern recognition  and neural networks. We are an interdisciplinary group with students coming from Electrical Engineering  Computer Science  Mathematics  and Physics. We work on a variety of projects analyzing and synthesizing systems that can be trained to perform their task. Learning is a topic that can be approached from different angles. For instance  one project deals with the rigorous mathematical analysis of over-learning; when a system memorizes too much detail about a limited experience. Another project develops techniques for selecting high-level features for pattern recognition. A third project applies learning to forecasting in the financial markets. We have an on-going research effort in learning from hints which generalizes the basic learning from examples; paradigm. Learning from examples assumes that the function we are trying to learn is represented to us by a training set of input/output examples  but is otherwise unknown. This poses a dilemma: We would like to use a learning model that is sophisticated enough to have a chance of implementing the unknown function  yet we want the model to be simple enough that a limited set of examples will suffice to tune it properly. Hints come in as a learning aid to improve the situation. We usually have  in addition to the set of examples of   some prior knowledge of certain facts about . We wish to use this side information to our advantage. For instance  we may know that is scale-invariant and monotonic  and we want to put this information together with the training set of examples to come up with a good implementation of . We want this process to be automated  so that the system is genuinely learning from hints. Our group has pioneered the use of hints in learning  and we continue to work on all aspects of the technique. The goal is to automate the use of hints to a degree where we can effectively utilize a large number of different hints that may be available in a practical situation. We have also developed a theoretical analysis of learning from hints. The analysis is based on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension provides an estimate for the number of examples the system will need to learn . The Learning Systems group is committed to the understanding of the fundamental components of automated learning  and to the development of real-life systems that utilize learning to achieve state-of-the art performance.

Our OM is based on system server concepts  presenting a standardized interface to C++ and Common Lisp (CL) programs. The MSO approach to persistence emphasizes (i) generality of source language support  (ii) portability and heterogeneity  (iii) data evolution  (iv) distributed implementation and access  and (v) the representation of software components as objects managed through a pervasive system service. Module manipulation tools: The Fast and Flexible Mach-based Systems project seeks to develop an operating system that provides a much higher degree of flexibility than do traditional systems  and to use that added flexibility to circumvent the performance/functionality tradeoffs that thwart traditional highly-decomposed  microkernel-based operating systems. Foundations for this work include (i) a comprehensive notion of modules  (ii) module manipulation cast as a system service  and (iii) a semantically enriched notion of module compatibility and adaptability. Items (i) and (ii) arose from the Mach Shared Objects project (see above)  while (iii) is a new emphasis motivated by pragmatically important inter-module concerns such as address space sharing  storage management policies  and levels of trust. Software for human genetics applications: In collaboration with the Utah Center for Human Genome Research  software is being developed to aid in genetic applications such as linkage analysis  genetic and physical mapping  and large scale genetic sequencing. Key aspects include (i) data modeling using relational and object-oriented database management systems  (ii) sequencing production workflow simulation  planning and real-time control  and (iii) automated inspection  monitoring  and robotic manipulation of biochemical laboratory processes. The educational dimension of this collaboration centers on an interdisciplinary program in genome science.

Carter Assistant Professor Computer Science Department University of Utah Professor Carter joined the Department of Computer Science in January 1993. His research interests include operating systems  parallel and distributed computing  and multiprocessor computer architecture. Of particular interest are scalable shared memory architecture designs  both hardware and software. Dr. Carter is co-leading two ARPA-sponsored research projects: the Avalanche scalable multiprocessor architecture design effort and the Fast and Flexible Mach-Based Systems effort (aka Mach 4). The development of an efficient and highly portable distributed shared memory system  Quarks  is part of this effort. While a graduate student at Rice University  he designed  implemented  and evaluated Munin  a distributed shared memory system that allows shared memory parallel programs to be executed efficiently on distributed memory multiprocessors. He has also worked on high speed bulk data communication protocols. For the Fall Quarter of 1995  I will be teaching the Introduction to Operating Systems course  CS506. Meeting times are Tuesday-Thursday from 1:10pm-2:35pm in EMCB 102. Current Research Projects Avalanche Scalable Multiprocessor Design: The goal of this project to develop an integrated cache  memory  and communication architecture that significantly reduces the latency of both distributed shared memory and message passage multiprocessor communication. The core processor of Avalanche will be the forthcoming PA-RISC 8000 CPU. We are designing a new Context Sensitive Cache Controller Unit that will support a flexible suite of cache coherence protocols for DSM applications and provide context sensitive injection of incoming data into the appropriate level of the memory hierarchy in order to minimize message latency. Primary research collaborators: Al Davis  Ravindra Kuramkote  and Chen-Chi Kuo. Other research collaborators: Mark Swanson  Leigh Stoller  Benny Yih  and Ashley Saulsbury. Fast and Flexible Mach-Based Systems: The goal of this project is to develop an operating system that provides a much higher degree of flexibility than traditional operating systems  and to use that added flexibility to circumvent the performance/functionality tradeoffs that thwart traditional highly-decomposed  microkernel-based operating systems. Important components of this work are a module management service  lightweight and decomposed Mach kernel functionality  aggressive exploitation of interprocess sharing  and efficient distributed shared memory (see below). We will maintain backward compatibility where practical  and freely distribute an unencumbered version of the entire system. Primary research collaborators: Jay Lepreau  Mike Hibler  Jeff Law  and Bryan Ford. Quarks Distributed Shared Memory System: The goal of this project is to develop an efficient  portable  and freely available distributed shared memory system to support the shared memory programming style on distributed memory multiprocessors and networks of workstations. Ideally  Quarks will eventually do for distributed shared memory what PVM did for message passing -- make it relatively easy to use  pervasive (ported to a wide array of systems)  and reasonably efficient. For more on our motivation  take a look at my HOTOS  95 position paper. An Alpha release of Quarks is currently available that runs on SunOS 4.1/SPARC machines  but ports are in progress to 68K BSD boxes  HP-UX/PA-RISC  IRIX 5.2/MIPS  and the Mach operating system. Primary research collaborators: Dilip Khandekar and Linus Kamb. Here is a copy of the slides for my OSDI  94 tutorial on distributed shared memory minus some of the graphs  which I will incorporate soon. Significant Past Research Projects Munin Distributed Shared Memory System: Munin was the first software distributed shared memory system to explore the potential performance benefits of using a relaxed consistency model. Among Munin s novel features were a software implementation of the release consistency model  the first multiple writer memory consistency protocol to address the problem of false sharing  support for multiple consistency protocols (including user-supplied protocols)  and an update timeout mechanism to reduce the communication overhead of write update protocols. For shared memory programs with moderate to high degrees of sharing  Munin achieved far greater performance (speedup) than conventional distributed shared memory systems  usually within 10% of hand coded message passing performance. Many of the features and ideas first developed in Munin have appeared in subsequent DSM systems. Primary research collaborators: Willy Zwaenepoel and John Bennett. Here is a copy of my dissertation concerning Munin. Optimistic Bulk Data Transfer Protocol: The key insight exploited in this effort was that when the first packet in a `blast  of bulk data is received by a node  it is highly likely that no packet outside the `blast  will arrive before the last bulk data packet is received. As such  upon receipt of the first packet in a blast of bulk data  the network device layer should set things up to optimize this case. This optimization  which was independently observed by Van Jacobson and incorporated into TCP/IP  resulted in 9.2 Mbps bulk data transfer rates between two SUN-3/50 s on a 10 Mbps Ethernet. At the time  the best TCP/IP implementations achieved under 5 Mbps bulk data transfer rates. Primary research collaborators: Willy Zwaenepoel. Selected Publications J.B. Carter  J.K. Bennett  and W.

This was a 5 gal. nursery stock sale plant that costing $5 for about 10 years ago. We blunt cut the top and let the new leader establish itself before establishing the shari. The tree is 36 inches tall. In the growing season this tree gets some pinching on a daily basis. Pinching the thing in one sitting is a bit much.This picture and description taken from rec.arts.bonsai.',\n",

Quotations and Dreams to Live By  Responsibility is not yours to toss away. It is a privilege  not a right. --Vice Admiral Richard Bolitho in Beyond the Reef by Alexander Kent  I wish to have no connection with ships that do not sail fast  for I intend to go in harm s way. --John Paul Jones  He rises fastest who knows not whither he is going. --Oliver Cromwell  It is confessed by all that from his youth he was of a vehement and impetuous nature  of a quick apprehension  and of a strong and aspiring bent for action and for great affairs. --Life of Themistocles by Plutarch Click here for Randy s Dreamhouse (200 KBytes). Absolutely essential features include the helipad  the submarine in the moat  the cool car  and the robot chef. My apologies to Matt Groening and  Life in Hell.  My History Up to Today I received my Ph.D. at Berkeley under Prof. Eugene Wong  working on database design and translation within the Ingres Relational Database project. I had the good fortune to have also worked one summer with the System-R Relational Database Group at IBM s San Jose Research Laboratory  so I was located in the center of the relational database design and implementation universe. After my Ph.D.  and some career fits and starts  I landed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison  where I shifted my interests into VLSI and CAD  in particular  database support for VLSI CAD environments. I was so successful  that an opportunity presented itself to return to Berkeley in 1983  which I accepted gladly  selling my snow tires. Since that time  my research and teaching interests have focused on the design  engineering  and implementation of advanced high performance computing systems. Always one to exhibit a short attention span  in 1984 I switched from CAD to processor and memory system design. Between 1985 and 1989  I led the design of the distributed cache and virtual memory organization of the SPUR multiprocessor project. We invented the term  snooping caches  (also known as  snoopy  caches)  and implemented one of the first invalidation protocols. The overall SPUR project was led by Dave Patterson  and involved Richard Fateman  Paul Hilfinger  Dave Hodges  and John Ousterhout. Snooping cache schemes are used in many multiprocessor servers on the market today. In 1986  I had an idea for building high performance storage systems by ganging together a large number of small formfactor disk drives  much like the processors in a multiprocessor. Between 1987 and 1992  I led the design and implementation of the Berkeley RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) high performance storage system (we coined the term  RAID ). This work was done in overall collaboration with Dave Patterson and John Ousterhout. Click here for a picture of  RAID the First  and here for a picture of  RAID the Second   which is still functional in 1996. This is the innovative  shelves of disks  that gave us such incredible MBytes per square foot for its time (72 3.5  disks in a 19  rack). This multibillion dollar per year industry all started with a simple idea in Berkeley in 1986! Too bad I didn t get any royalities. Unsatisfied with academic life  as usual   and after the elections of 1992  I decided to take a leave during 1993-1994 at the Computing Systems Technology Office (now  Information Technology Office ) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. I started as a program manager and ended as an office deputy director. However  along the way  I was responsible for establishing whitehouse.gov and the president and vice.president Internet mail accounts  I participated on Vice President Gore s National Performance Review  and played a lead role in formulating the Federal HPCC program s Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications research program in support of the Administration s National Information Infrastructure Initiative.

To read about my Washington experiences  see my draft paper Prof. Katz WENT to Washington in html. Bill Clinton is an interesting guy  but I am really looking forward to voting for Al Gore for President in the Year 2000! On July 1  1996  I became the first Computer Scientist to be the Chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Research Interests of the Moment Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Growing out of Bob Brodersen s InfoPad Project  we have been working to develop wireless networking and applications support technologies that make it possible to support seamless roaming within buildings and over the wide area  while efficiently supporting applications that process real-time streams like video as well as web documents. Our current interest is to examine the issues of wireless/wireline network integration  internetwork operation  and end-to-end quality of service guarantees in the context of a local-area wireless testbed in Soda Hall and a wide-area testbed located in the San Francisco Bay Area. The overall effort  in collaboration with Eric Brewer  is called the Daedalus Project. The combined in-building  metropolitan-area  and wide-area testbed is called BARWAN (Bay Area Research Wireless Access Network). This work is supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its GloMo Program. Heterogeneous Collaboration Environments With Steve McCanne  who is joining the faculty this year  we are studying how to extend the technology we have developed for adapting data representations in real-time into a comprehensive open framework for collaboration. Elements of this new effort include room-sized collaboration environments  extensive enhancements to the existing MBone collaboration tools  and integration of wireless access into the collaboration environment. We expect to deploy these technologies in a classroom testbed within Soda Hall. Click here to see a version of our DARPA proposal that supports this work. Faculty Book Club With several of the CS faculty (and other interested faculty members elsewhere on campus)  I have established a reading club to discuss controversial books somewhat related to computing technology and the future of the field. This is the list of books we have read so far: George Gilder  Life After Television  Norton  New York  1992. Robert Frank and Philip Cook  The Winner Take All Society  Free Press  New York  1995. Neal Stephenson  The Diamond Age  Bantam  New York  1995. John Horgan  The End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age  Addison Wesley  Reading  MA  1996.

Schlichting Rick received the B.A. degree in history and mathematics (computer science option) from the College of William and Mary in 1977  and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Cornell University in 1979 and 1982  respectively. Since 1982  Rick has been in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Arizona   where he is currently holds the rank of Professor. His research interests include distributed systems  fault-tolerant computing  and heterogeneous scientific applications. In the latter area  he heads the Schooner Project   whose goal is to provide software support for constructing scientific meta-computations across networks of heterogeneous machines. Much of his current work in fault-tolerant computing involves using the x-kernel in various ways to support fault-tolerance  and is done in cooperation with members of the Network Systems Research Group . He currently supervises one postdoctoral associate ( Matti Hiltunen )  and four graduate students ( Nina Bhatti   Ilwoo Chang  Xiaonan Han  and Don Waugaman ). Rick is also active in promoting increased interaction between U.S. and Japanese computer scientists. He spent seven months in 1990 visiting the Katayama Laboratory at Tokyo Institute of Technology   where he worked on using an attribute-grammar formalism to implement fault-tolerant software. He is currently spending a year at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory near Tokyo working on various software issues related to heterogeneous scientific computation. Both of these visits have been supported by the NSF U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program. Rick is a member of ACM  IEEE  and the IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault-Tolerance. He is on the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Computers  IEEE Parallel and Distributed Technology  and the Springer-Verlag series on Dependable Computing and Fault-Tolerant Systems. He is also current Vice-Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Fault-Tolerant Computing  and has served on numerous conference program committees in the areas of fault tolerance and distributed computing. He was General Chair of the Second IFIP Working Conference on Dependable Computing for Critical Applications in 1991  and Program Committee Chair of the Thirteenth IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Computing in 1994. As part of his Japan activities  Rick heads the JapanCS Project   and is founder and current moderator of the USENET newsgroup comp.research.japan   an electronic forum devoted to Japanese research developments in computing and computer science. He is also a member of the Association of Research Libraries Working Group on Japanese Scientific and Technical Information. When not working  Rick likes to haunt local Japanese restaurants with his family. Their favorite is Samurai  which during the winter months serves the best miso ramen this side of Japan. Rick also follows the Arizona Wildcat sports teams.

Process algebras have been widely studied for modelling concurrent processes. One of Prof. Zwarico s primary research interests is in extending this formalism so that it can be used in the specification and analysis of real-time systems and also systems with probabilistic behavior. Research in this area has produced semantic models for both real-time and probabilistic processes as well as logics for reasoning about these processes. In addition  she has used some of the techniques from process algebra in the verification of both synchronous and asynchronous circuits. In conjunction with Prof. Smith  Prof. Zwarico has developed and proven correct a method of synthesizing correct gate-level descriptions of circuits.She and Prof. Smith are also investigating various areas in the semantics of object oriented programming.

Assorted geeeky acts like memorising the schedule for Indian Railways (North Zone) at an early age showed to all and sundry that he was destined to be a Professor. He set out to fulfil this prediction with gusto  in the process asking long  complicated and troublesome questions of his teachers at Modern School and IIT Delhi. While in his senior years in high school  and through his undergraduate education  he continued his interest in asking (and answering) questions by representing his institutions in debating and quizzing at an intercollegiate level. He also got involved in research activities  which lead him to Purdue University in 1989  from where he obtained his Ph.D degree in 1993. Currently  he is found raoming the campus of the University of Missouri in the guise of an assistant professor. He continues to ask many questions  though he concentrates on answering only some of them. These are detailed next ..... Research My research focusses on Intelligent Networked Systems   and covers the broad area of Networked Systems and Artificial/Computational Intelligence. Of particular interest to me is the use of Distributed AI (Adaptive MultiAgent Systems) and soft AI (NeuroFuzzy Learning) approaches. I am working on using techniques from Computational Intelligence and Agent-based systems to aid in the effort of realizing MetaComputing or Networked computing  especially for the Scientific Computing domain. This involves creating problem solving environments (PSEs) which make the underlying neworked and distributed system transparent to the user. This work also looks at supporting mobile and ubiquitous platforms by making systems mobile aware. To this end we do research in various facets of Mobile Computing. I also investigate and using such systems with multimedia to improve education and telelearning. This work was started while I was at Purdue  as a part of the efforts of the PSEs group (John Rice  Elias Houstis and Sanjiva Weerawarana) and the Telematics group (Ahmed Elmagarmid  Elias Houstis and Mike Atallah). Another current research activity deals computer & human vision  and explores the nature of motion correspondence process in biological systems  using relevant information from Neurobiology and Psychophysics. I am also working on understanding the effect of the geometry of visual space on the human ability to solve difficult problems.

Fundamentally  the role of an operating system is to abstract the physical resources of the underlying hardware  and to multiplex these resources among multiple application programs and users. In this role as a mediator between application programs and underlying hardware  modern operating systems are being challenged on both fronts. On the one hand  operating systems are expected to efficiently support a broad range of application programs  including scientific  engineering  business  and entertainment applications. On the other hand  a single operating system is expected to efficiently run on a wide range of computer systems  ranging from PDAs and personal computers to parallel supercomputers  all connnected by networks with widely differing performance characteristics. Peter s long-term research goal is to develop an operating system that can be configured to run on radically different distributed hardware platforms  and whose services can be dynamically customized and extended to efficiently support specific applications. Towards this end  his research focuses on two issues: Communications-oriented OS design Current operating systems are well suited for applications that spend most of their time operating on data stored in main memory  and that perform occasional  coarse-grained I/O operations on slow devices. To satisfy modern distributed applications that perform frequent  fine-grained I/O on fast devices  operating systems must (1) minimize kernel involvement in common case I/O operations  and (2) tightly manage system resources to maintain fairness and quality of service. Application-specific customization of OS services Existing operating systems offer applications a fixed set of services with black box implementations. This approach fails to address the needs of an increasing range of applications that all demand performance  but have widely varying service needs and usage patterns. We investigate customizable operating system services that allow applications to tailor service implementations so that they meet precisely their needs in functionality and performance.

Current Research Projects High Performance Computing for Land Cover Dynamics. This NSF funded Grand Challenge project focuses on the use of high performance computing for addressing problems in analysis of remotely sensed images. New algorithms and data structures for image classification  mixture modeling and map and image databases are being developed as part of this program. A presentation describing the structure and highlights of this program can be found by clicking here . Visual navigation . A collaborative research project with the Universities of Pennsylvania and Rochester and the National Institute of Standards and Technology is addressing the problem of identifying and tracking moving objects (specifically vehicles) from a moving platform. This project is part of ARPA s unmanned ground vehicle program (UGV). Research at Maryland focuses on image stabilization and estimation of egomotion from time varying images. Additionally  we have studied the use of radial basis function neural networks for road navigation. For some online videos showing the results of Maryland s Datacube stabilization algorithms check out Carlos Morimoto s home page . Looking at people s faces . This research focuses on the analysis of time varying images of humans to recognize facial expressions as well as other facial actions (blinking  head gestures  etc.) A database containing over 100 000 images of more than 70 subjects displaying a variety of expressions has been collected  and parts of the database are available on CD ROM. To view a movie illustrating this research  click video clip (1.9 MB) . Looking at people in action. We are investigating the problem of recognizing natural human activities (e.g.  types of calisthetic exercises) based on multi-camera time varying image analysis. A small database of nine views of a human performing two types of activities was acquired at Carnegie Mellon University  and we are currently attempting to develop algorithms for reconstructing the sequence of instantaneous configurations of the human based on integration of analysis from these nine views over time. More recent work investigates the problem of finding and tracking people in both IR and color video  and recognizing their interactions with one another and with objects in their environments. Research Infrastructure for High Performance Computing. This is an NSF grant that provided funds for the acquisition of two high performance computers for the UMIACS/CSD high performance computing laboratory. The two machines acquired are a 16 node IBM SP2 (to be configured as a machine for I/O research with over 250GB of disk and a tertiary storage system) and a 10 node Alpha workstation farm.

Gagliardi Ugo Gagliardi Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Computer Engineering Professor Gagliardi conducts research in three areas  systems architecture  systems performance  and software reusability. In the area of systems architecture  he works on innovative architectures for multiprocessing integrated data from voice PBXs and general purpose computers. He has developed design methods for handling real systems that incorporate the concepts of abstraction and modularization into basic software engineering. To assess the performance of computing systems  Professor Gagliardi has developed mathematical tools that significantly simplify the analysis of server networks under multiprocessing conditions. He has determined the performance limits of bus-oriented multiprocessing architectures and identified their principal performance bottlenecks. In the area of software reusability  Professor Gagliardi has developed a theoretical paradigm that links models of software engineering and configuration management with alternative methods of\\\\0software porting. With this paradigm  it is possible to formulate models for estimating the time and resources required by distinct porting approaches. He has also developed innovative approaches to software porting that use automatic translators of a rule-based type  i.e.  porting expert systems. U. O. Gagliardi  P. Ravisio  and F.

Current directory based cache protocols are not designed to exploit multicast hardware that is likely to be provided in future wormhole routers. I am currently investigating new cache protocols to take advantage of network abilities and new routing protocols that support cache coherence and synchronization traffic efficiently. One possible solution may lead to the design of integrated router and cache controllers. In my recent work  I have investigated methods to enhance known wormhole routing algorithms to handle faults  deadlock issues in multicast communication  and design of new wormhole routing algorithms. I am applying my results on fault-tolerant and multicast communication to current router designs such as the multichip routers implemented in Cray T3D(TM) to study the design of next generation routers and switch fabrics for high-speed local area networks.

Wilson) on nighthawk.cise.ufl.edu I m the Associate Chair of the University of Florida s Computer & Information Science & Engineering Department. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia Department of Computer Science in 1985. My interests lie in Programming Languages  Computer Vision  and the boundary where these two areas of study meet. Image Algebra Nowadays I m most closely associated with the Image Algebra Project. The goal of this project is the development of a formal mathematical notation well-suited to the expression of image-processing and computer-vision algorithms. This has led to numerous mathematical results as well as the development of the image algebra C++ class library (iac++). Gerhard Ritter and I have written the Handbook of Computer Vision Algorithms in Image Algebra. It is in publication with CRC Press. It contains a brief introduction to image algebra and shows how it can be applied by specifying over 80 computer vision and image processing algorithms. Administrivia I have a small collection of CIS Department and University of Florida administrative information. Marlais Dylan Interpreter I maintain the Marlais interpreter. This is a freely available interpreter for a language approximating Apple Computer s dynamic object-oriented programming language Dylan. Image Algebra Course During the fall semester of 1996  I am teaching a course on Image Algebra (CAP 6418 sec. 4694X). Object-Oriented Programming During the spring semester of 1996  I am teaching an Object-Oriented Programming (CIS 4930 sec. 0998X). Facilities and Equipment Committee I maintain some information about the Department Facilities and Equipment Committee. 1994-95 TIP Award Portfolio I was selected for a 1994-95 TIP award. My application portfolio is available for browsing. Old Image Algebra Course During the spring semester of 1995 I taught a course on Image Algebra (CIS 6930 Section 0942V). Old OOP Course Info During the spring semester of 1995  I taught an Object-Oriented Programming (CIS 4930 sec. 0939X).

Ph.D.  Northwestern University Graph theory  which is intimately related to many branches of mathematics  has become a powerful tool in the understanding and solution of problems arising in many fields of science and engineering. My main research interest is the application of graph theory in various areas of computer science and engineering. These areas include computer networks  algorithm design  and fault-tolerant computing. My usual practice has been to start with an open problem in these areas and to see a graph-theoretic approach for its solution.

We beleive Axon to be the first zero-copy host network interface  and the first use of distributed virtual shared memory over a wide area network. The Next Generation Internetworking During 1987-92  my students and I worked on a research project concerned with the design of the next generation of internet architecture. (If you are interested in RSVP and Integrated Services work in IETF  you should look at our earlier work.) Important aspects of this project include: Design  specification  and prototype implementation of a novel multipoint  congram-oriented  service that can work well with connection-oriented and datagram high speed networks  can provide variable grade service on a need basis to its applications  and can provide adequate reconfigurability to deal with survivability requirements due to network failures. For details on a prototype implementation  check this paper out on COIP-K . Design and implementation of gateway architectures that can support data rates of a few hundred Mbps  can interface with diverse networks  and can implement the congram-oriented service without becoming a performance bottleneck. For details on our work on a ATM-FDDI gateway  click here . Development of analytical and simulation models to evaluate important tradeoffs associated with the design of a congram-oriented protocol  the resource management on diverse networks  and the design of new gateway architectures.

For students (especially when a project deadline approaches): Don t tell me how hard you work  tell me how much you get done. Sign of arrogance: My opinions may have changed but not the fact that I am right. A model is an artifice for helping you convince yourself that you understand more about a system than you do. A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible.

Much of his work has dealt with computing a structure called the Voronoi diagram and its geometric dual the Delaunay Triangulation. In particular  he has invented algorithms for computing the Voronoi Diagram of line segments  for Voronoi diagrams when distances are measured by Convex Distance Functions  and for Voronoi diagrams which simulate crystal growth. He has found ways to use the Delaunay triangulation to find fixed-radius near neighbors  to find the k nearest neighbors of each point in a set  and to enumerate pairs of points in increasing order of interpoint distance. Professor Drysdale has also done work on computing greedy triangulations and has been working with a Mechanical Engineer in the area of Numerical Control (NC) machining.

Widlund Professor of Computer Science and Mathematics Throughout his career  Olof Widlund has focused on numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. His primary concern has been new algorithms and mathematical tools for their analysis. In recent years  with his students and other associates  he has concentrated his efforts on domain decomposition algorithms for the large linear systems of algebraic equations that arise in many computational continuum mechanics problems  for example in fluid dynamics and elasticity. These algorithms use a preconditioned conjugate gradient approach and they are designed with parallel and distributed computers in mind. A main challenge is to overcome the potential computational bottleneck arising because the solutions of the linear systems depend on the data everywhere in the region. These algorithms are being increasingly accepted by the user community and their usefulness on loosely coupled systems has been demonstrated in several careful experimental studies. Since 1989  nine students have completed doctorates in this field of research.

Research Description  I get payed a lot of money. The least I can do is get it right.  --- Peter Jennings  ABC News. We are developing performance analysis tools and effective control strategies for congestion-control and resource-management protocols in computer networks. In the initial phase of this research we studied the fundamental properties of distributed algorithms for congestion control and the impact of system parameters on performance. We had some success with a two-dimensional Brownian motion model for a system with adaptive con trol. With the experience and insight gained over the last several years  the study has evolved into a platform that encompasses: statistically accurate workload models which are essential to effective congestion-controland resource-management  and algorithms for congestion-control and resource-management that are developed and evaluated using these workload models. Selected results to-date include: Time-series models for Internet traffic Trace-sampling (a method for generating synthetic traffic traces). The described inventions are covered by provisional patent application in the United States  entitled  Trace Sampling  and bearing Serial Number 60/005  112.

In the Spring  I m going to be teaching a new course: CMSC498P - Advanced Object Oriented Programming Web stuff Java stuff: I ve compiled a list of Java resources  including information about a Java course I offered via ITV June 5th and 6th. Introductory WWW tutorial : I wrote an introductory WWW tutorial you are invited to read. I ve written it to bring it up to date with HTML 2.0. POPL97 Web pages: I m building and maintaining web pages for POPL97: the ACM conference on Principles of Programming Languages  to be held in Paris  1997. Friday faculty lunch: I organize lunch orders and deliveries for Friday Faculty Lunches. As part of this  I ve scanned in the menus for a number of restraurants in the College Park Area that deliver. RESEARCH INTERESTS: The design and analysis of practical algorithms and data structures  both in general and for problems that arise in the implementation of programming languages and environments are under investigation. I developed skip lists  a probabilistic data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees. Although a skip list may not be balanced  the probability of a skip list being substantially unbalanced is insignificant. Algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are simpler and faster than equivalent algorithms for balanced trees. My current research focuses on compilation techniques for making effective use of massive parallelism for computationally intensive scientific problems. I am investigating algorithms for data dependence analysis in program  programming languages for scientific computations  and a framework for performing loop transformations of programs to improve their performance when executed on massively parallel computers. Most recently  my research has focused on the use of integer programming algorithms in array data dependence analysis. Although that integer programming is NP-complete  the Omega test  an algorithm I developed  is efficient for problems that arise in practice. In examining the question of array data dependence more closely  I have found that the queries that really need to be asked are more complicated than can be answered using integer programming and that we really need decision procedures for a subclass of Presburger arithmetic. I have been able to extend the Omega test so that it can answer these queries. A longer discussion of the Omega project can be found here.

Sprague Associate Professor Schedule Research Interests Parallel Graph Algorithm and Computational Geometry The parallel graph algorithm research centers on algorithms for special classes of graphs  such as chordal graphs. Similar techniques and concepts lead to algorithms for certain computational geometry problems  such as a parallel algorithm to construct the constraint graph  used in compaction of VLSI circuits. Parallel Tree Search Algorithms Tree searching methods are used in artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization  plus various other areas. Branch and bound is one tree search method. This research centers on how to partition the branch-and-bound task for a multiprocessor  and how to partition the data structures used  both for shared memory and distributed memory systems. Other research addresses different search strategies  including alpha-beta minimax  best-first  and breadth-first  to name a few. The issues being addressed include distributing the coach among either shared memory multiprocessors or distributed memory multiprocessors  and interprocessor communication to maximize search efficiency by letting each processor show search information.

Selected Current Research Projects Extending ATM Networks for Reliable Multicast. This project involves extending ATM switches to assist in the provision of end-to-end reliable multicast in which the amount of work that must be done by senders and receivers is essentially independent of the size of the multicast. It involves the addition of several mechanisms to ATM switches. One mechanism provides redundant acknowledgement suppression so that senders receive only a single acknowledgement for every packet sent. A second mechanism allows multiple senders on a many-to-many multicast to send multi-cell packets on a single virtual circuit without losing the ability to properly demultiplex them at the receiver. This is done using a dynamic virtual circuit subchannel mechanism. Details can be found in in a recently completed technical report and set of slides. Gigabit ATM Switching. We re nearing completion of a set of three chips and associated hardware and software that implements a uniquely scalable and flexible ATM switch. supporting link speeds from 150 Mb/s to 2.4 Gb/s and capable of supporting configurations with total throughputs from 10 Gb/s to more than 10 Tb/s. This system uses a unique cell recycling technique for multicast switching which has optimal scaling properties  allowing large switches to be implemented for a fraction of the cost of competing architectures [TU93c TU94 TU96]. This work is part of a major ARPA-funded project on gigabit network technology. ATM Network Design. Classical network design techniques are not well-equipped to cope with the design of ATM networks  which are characterized by statistically unpredictable traffic and a wide range of different application types with diverse requirements  including multicast. Network design methods that allow network managers to define traffic requirements at a fairly gross level and adopt a worst-case approach to network design appear to be more appropriate. See the following reports for recent results [FI94 FI96a FI96b]. Distributed Control of ATM Networks The design of ATM switching hardware is now fairly well-understood. However  distributed control systems for effectively managing large scale networks (with thousands or millions of terminals) remain unavailable. While a number of proposals have been put forward in the ATM Forum  there is a limited understanding of how competing approaches compare with respect to performance  use of network resources and even correctness. We are developing a framework for precisely defining and analyzing network control systems that allows the essential issues to be separated from the welter of protocol and implementation details that often make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons [TU95b] and using this framework to develop precise characterizations of new approaches to distributed network control [WU95]. In addition  we have designed and are implementing a particular network control system details of which can be found in [DH94 DH95]. Copies of slides from a recent presentation (keynote talk for ATM workshop at Georgetown University  10/30--11/1/95) can be found here. Project Ideas Here is a list of project ideas for graduate students. They range in difficulty from senior or masters design project ideas through doctoral research. Double speed port processor for a gigabit ATM switch. ATM congestion control mechanism using frame level discarding. ATM switch support for reliable multicast communication. Adaptive resequencing in an ATM switching system. Selected Past Research Activities Queueing Analysis of Multistage Switching Networks. Multistage switching networks are among the simplest and most cost-effective architectures for large ATM switching systems. This work developed new methods for analyzing queueing performance for these systems  in order to improve accuracy and extend them to handle shared-buffer switch elements and alternative flow control strategies [TU93a TU93b]. Nonblocking Multirate Switching. This work extends the classical theory of nonblocking networks to apply to switching systems supporting communication channels with different rates that can share the capacity of both external links and internal switch data paths. It applies directly to multirate circuit switching and ATM switching systems that use static routing. We ve obtained results generalizing classical results for both point-to-point [ME89a ME89b] and multipoint [ME93a] switching systems. Analysis of Algorithms for Hard Combinatorial Problems. This research centers on methods for analyzing the performance of algorithms for hard combinatorial problems. We are interested in both worst-case analysis and probabilistic analysis. The probabilistic analyses make use of problem-specific probability distributions selected to help clarify real differences among competing algorithms [TU86 TU88].

TEACHING This semester I am teaching Programming I (C++) and Advanced Programming Languages. INTERESTS I am generally interested in artificial intelligence  cognitive science  and machine learning. Specifically  I am interested in teaching artificial neural networks (aka  connectionist networks) how to perform high-level cognitive tasks such as analogy-making. I plan on forming an Artificial Intelligence Lab here at the University of Arkansas where we will study robots  machine learning  neural networks  and other forms of artificial intelligence. The emphasis will be on systems capabable of learning high-level cognitive abilities starting with nothing but low-level perceptions. I have also been working on organizing a Cognitive Science Program here as well. If you have ideas  comments  or questions  feel free to drop me a line.

Boult This is Terry Boult s home page. Mouse my face for a color photo. I am now a visiting scientist in the Department of Computer Science of Columbia University. I m an Associate professor in the EE/CS department of Lehigh University. My research interests span vision  numeric computing  information-based complexity  image processing  object oriented software  and light-wave networks. To learn more about my research see TBoult s Research Page I am also an ex-Columbia-faculty (86-94)  an ex-Columbia-graduate student (MS in CS 83-84  Ph.D. in CS 84-86) and an ex-Columbia-undergraduate (B.S. Applied Math 79-83). As a doctoral student I received an IBM graduate fellowship. I was awarded an NSF Presidential Young Investigator (1990) and have support from NSF (3 other grants)  ARPA  and industrial funding from AT&T  IBM  Texas Instruments and Siemens. Eight CU doctoral students have graduated under my direction  two of them (G. Wolberg and L. Wolff) have since won NSF NYI s. In 1990 I received the NCR Stakeholder award which is given from time to time to an outstanding EE or CS faculty member at Columbia. While I m not paid by Columbia  I still visit a bit because I have students here including Ph.D. students: Lisa Brown Ming Chao Chiang Sam Fenster Tom O Donnell and few undergraduates and MS students. M.  Russell  Sarder Veronica Hidalgo I maintain research connections to the Vision/Robotics Lab with Prof Peter Allen Prof. John Kender and Prof. Shree Nayar I also have research collaborations with the information-based complexity group of Prof. J.F.Traub Prof. H. Wozniakowski Visiting Prof. Art Werschulz S. Paskov and S. Baker See also CAC-NET which is an electronic conferencing system for researchers in algorithms and complexity. I dabble a bit in many things including vision  numeric computing  image processing  object oriented software  and light-wave networks. I also enjoy Baking  board games  boating  cooking  fishing  guitar  golf  hiking  poetry  racket sports  scuba diving  skiing/shredding  swimming  volleyball and water skiing. (When I get the time  of course ;-) I m even decent at a few of these  e.g. I placed first in the 1991-1992 Budweiser/NASTAR All-star ranking for New Jersey skiers in the 30-39 age bracket with a time was just 5\\\\% behind that posted by the NASTAR National Pace-setter  U.S. Olympian Matt Grosjean.

Ph.D. in Computer Engineering  University of Florida  Gainsville. Member of the Institute of Information Science of Academia Sinica. Taught at Taiwan University  Taipei. Taught at University of Santa Clara  Santa Clara  California. RESEARCH TOPICS Dr. Hong s research focuses on a dataflow/von Neumann hybrid architecture for efficient pipelined execution of dataflow program graphs. This includes the study of mechanisms for reducing the scheduling gap between a dataflow instruction and its consumer instruction(s)  and the issues of partitioning and compilation of the program graph to maximize the use of the normal  IP+1  instruction scheduling of a von Neumann processor  where the IP stands for instructional pointer. Other research interests include incorporation of dataflow ideas into RISC processors for parallel execution  and study of the architecture of each node in a general purpose  massively parallel architectures.

Calif at Berkeley Berkeley CA 94720-1776 My interests include Scientific programming environments; Algebraic manipulation by computer (programs like Macsyma  Mathematica  Maple  Axiom  Reduce); Distributed computing; analysis of algorithms; Programming and measurement of large systems; Design and implementation of programming languages; Optical character recognition. There is a public ftp repository of programs  papers  and reviews written by my students and myself ... I ve linked a subset of them here: Berkeley computer algebra papers. Some pointers to work in symbolic mathematical computing can be found by visiting SymbolicNet. You might also visit Berkeley OCR/math papers. If you are interested in an ambitious senior project OCR program using C++  Tcl/TK  visit OCRchie. You might like to visit our prototype TILU on-line table-lookup Symbolic Integration Service. You can also get a copy of 2171 integrals that TILU can do  and see if you can do them all  and if you can do them faster. This table combines many simple examples (for timing) and a few harder ones near the end (for challenges). This is a preliminary version  and doesn t include that much of the literature on integration yet. Here s the list of examples as of May 23  1996. It is 163k bytes. We have a file with the answers too  naturally. Our answers may be more cautious than those that come out of a computer algebra system. For example  our answers will sometimes include variations that depend on constraints on the parameters in the integrand. If you wonder what our answer is  you can try TILU: paste the integrand -- the part between  (INTEGRATE  and   X)  into the input box  set up appropriate limits  and execute the query. Computer algebra fans may also wish to see work done by my colleague John Canny. and his students  including applications of algebraic algorithms. Other work at Berkeley by colleagues in scientific computing can be found by following the links to their home pages: James Demmel and William Kahan. Visitors to this page may be interested in a Common Lisp package and libraries called Mockmma. To the user  this somewhat resembles Mathematica (tm)  but has the advantage of being totally open (full source code). One can manipulate polynomials in several variables over the integers  rational functions  and a variety of other mathematical objects. Manipulations include simplification  differentiation  integration  evaluation  pattern matching  etc. Some of you may wonder what kind of optical character recognition we are doing on equations  so you might wish to see a few scanned equations to see what this is about. We are also drafting a brief discussion on an OCR equation-recognition challenge . We hope to develop more expertise in understanding documents as part of an Electronic Environmental Library Project. I am on sabbatical in the Fall  1996 semester  but I expect to continue running a seminar discussing issues of the electronic library project CS298-23  document structure analysis .

Of particular interest are structures which improve system performance and ones which allow new applications - tasks which were previously not doable because of a lack of appropriate data structures. He is also interested in database architectures  in improving the usability of software systems  and in computer science education. In the area of file structures  he is currently investigating improvements to perfect hashing techniques  file structures for use with optical disks and with information filtering. In database architecture  he is examining distributed architectures which incorporated recent computer technologies such as optical disks. For user interfaces  he is considering what makes computer software usable. In computer science education  he is interested in encouraging greater emphasis on teaching endeavors and in improving the quality of instruction.

He received his Masters degree in 1968 and Ph.D. in 1971 from the University of Kentucky. Dr. Cheatham taught mathematics and computer science at Samford University in Birmingham Alabama from 1971-1980. In 1980  he accepted a position in the Computer Science Department at Western Kentucky University where he taught nearly every course in the BS and MS programs before leaving in 1990 to become Chair of the Computer Science Department at MTSU. In 1987  Dr. Cheatham was selected as Western Kentucky University s Outstanding Teacher  an honor which he still cherishes. Even as department head  teaching is still very much a part of his life and an endeavor to which he commits much energy and time. Dr. Cheatham also enjoys cooperative research and a game of racquetball with his students and friends.

His career switch was due to the lean job market more than anything else. Today  however  his training in philosophy holds him in good stead. McNaughton  who is author of the textbook Elementary Computability  Formal Languages and Automata published by Prentice-Hall  is now looking at problems in the combinatorics of words  a branch of formal languages. Formal languages deal with symbolic logic and computer languages as opposed to the natural languages used in human speech and general-purpose writing. His research is being coordinated with computer scientists formerly at the GE Research and Development Center in nearby Niskayuna  New York. This group at GE was called the Theorem Proving Group. Members of this group are now in the Computer Science Department at the University at Albany and in the Computer Science Department at RPI. Their research was concerned with looking at formal linguistic systems for the sake of carrying through proofs on the machine. For example  they have looked at ways to improve the efficiency of Thue systems  a linguistic method developed by Norwegian logician Axel Thue in 1914. Thue systems are useful for computation because they replace strings (connected characters) with other strings  carrying through a rather basic kind of computer operation.

Gonzalez Room 2119  Engineering I Department of Computer Science University of California Santa Barbara  CA 93106-5110 Internet:teo@cs.ucsb.edu Telephone:(805) 893-3849 Facsimile:(805) 893-8553 Ph.D.  University of Minnesota 1975 Research interests: computer-aided design  VLSI placement and routing algorithms  scheduling theory  design and analysis of algorithms. Dr. Gonzalez received the B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey (1972) and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota  Minneapolis  (1975). Professor Gonzalez research activity has concentrated on the development of efficient exact and approximation algorithms for problems in several disciplines. In the area of computer-aided design of integrated circuits and systems  he developed efficient algorithms for component placement and wire routing for VLSI and MPCB systems. Specifically  he has developed efficient algorithms for channel  rectangle  and switchbox routing problems  via assignment  via placement  pin redistribution  and layer assignment for VLSI and MPCB systems. Dr. Gonzalez has also investigated the complexity of generating exact and approximate solutions to a set of computational geometry problems. Specifically  he has developed some very interesting algorithms for partitioning  grouping and covering problems. These are robust algorithms that generalize to any number of dimensions. These problems have applications in computer-aided design  cluster analysis  etc. He has also developed efficient approximation algorithms for deterministic scheduling problems. These problems have applications in manufacturing systems as well as in task assignment in real-time multiprocessor systems. He has developed efficient algorithms for preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling problems in open  flow and job shops  as well as in identical  uniform and unrelated processor systems. Dr. Gonzalez has also developed exact and approximation algorithms for graph problems  code minimization  two-dimensional map compression  generalized dictionaries  statistical tests  page fault minimization  etc. Professor Gonzalez is currently working on Multi-Message Multicasting algorithms for networks. The is a fundamental problem that arises when executing program in parallel computer systems. Some applications include iterative methods for solving systems of linear and non-linear equations  and most dynamic programming procedures  etc. His work has been published in the Journal of ACM  SIAM Journal on Computing  Information Processing Letters  Integration: The VLSI Journal  as well as in IEEE Transactions  Other General Theory Journals  Computational Geometry Journals  Operations Research Journals  Other Journals and Research Books  and Conference Proceedings. In addition  his work has been presented in Conferences. Professor Gonzalez is an Editor of IEEE Transactions on Computers. He has received the Outstanding Computer Science Professor of the Year Award in 1987 and 1994. Dr. Gonzalez current research interests are the design of efficient algorithms for multimessage multicasting in networks  scheduling in unrelated processor systems  component placement and wire routing problems with applications in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) of Integrated Systems and Circuits; and algorithms for partitioning  grouping and covering problems.

There are many inter-related areas that impact the security of systems: user-interfaces  software systems design  theorem proving  and cryptography all play important roles. One particular area that Bennet has been working on is the secure coprocessor model  where physically secure (tamper-detecting/-proof) hardware is added to conventional computing systems. We perform security-critical operations such as the execution of cryptographic protocols and access control decisions only within secure coprocessors  where both privacy of key material and integrity of security databases are axiomatic -- thereby bootstrapping security properties from the secure coprocessor to the entire system as a whole. This work includes some (minimal) hardware design  operating system implementation (porting Mach 3.0 microkernel to the prototype hardware)  and cryptographic protocol design. Much of this work was done jointly with Doug Tygar at Carnegie Mellon and IBM s Embedded Cryptographic Systems group. More recently  Bennet has been examining the design of practical cryptographic protocols for efficient and yet secure Internet-based transactions  secure-coprocessor-based applications  and electronic commerce. He was one of the coauthors of the PCT protocol from Microsoft  and more recently he s been working with Netscape  Microsoft  and others within the framework of the Internet Engineering Task Force to come up with a merged protocol satisfactory to all parties. Bennet maintains a list of Web resources relating to computer security  ranging from cryptography resources  system security testing tools  to word compilations useful in eliminating easy-to-guess passwords. In addition to looking at the World Wide Web from the security and internet commerce point of view  Bennet also indulges plain old fun hacks and Web-based link collecting. (See also his web links page). His web pages here are still being worked on. You may be interested in bsy s web pages at CMU. Some of Bennet s papers are online. His PGP public key is available. Bennet is teaching CSE 30 and CSE 291 this quarter. Bennet taught CSE 80 in spring 1996; the archived web pages from the course is still available.

At least some of these tools should be usesable by non-programmers  enabling a wide range of designers to create interesting VR applications. The MR Toolkit: The MR Toolkit is a set of software tools for the production of VR applications that has been under development for the past 5 years. This toolkit is freely distributed to non-commercial organizations  and there are currently over 340 sites. ATM Protocol Visualization: Testing and evaluating ATM networks can be a challenging problem due to the large volume of data that can flow over a network connection. It is possible to collect the data flowing over a network connection  but analyzing this large volume of data requires visualization techniques that allow engineers to view a significant portion of this data at various level of detail.

Zegura Assistant Professor College of Computing Georgia Institute of Technology Biography Ellen W. Zegura received the B.S. degree in Computer Science (1987)  the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (1987)  the M.S. degree in Computer Science (1990) and the D.Sc. in Computer Science (1993) all from Washington University  St. Louis  Missouri. Her graduate research involved the analysis of switching networks to support multipoint and multirate communication. This work included the development of analytic models to evaluate blocking probability in multipoint switching topologies  as well as the development and application of a methodology for comparing switch architectures using a model of cost that is closely coupled to implementation technologies. Her current interest is in wide-area networking support for complex applications. In particular  the projects focus on dealing with fluctuations in wide-area performance that occur on a time scale that is slow enough to be tractable  yet fast enough to require dynamic  on-line solutions. The complexity in applications may come  for example  from multi-stream interactions  widely varying quality of service requirements  or dynamic multicast session membership. The solutions involve both network architectures and algorithms  as well as end-to-end solutions. More detail on particular projects may be found below.

I prefer the Sumatra Blue Linoting beans that Trader Joes sells or a brand called Dancing Goats that Batdorf Bronson roasters ships to me retail. Basically a medium smooth roast is best for me. Fine coffee should be savored and certainly no fake powdered milk should be used in it. The Cafe San VIP Sanyo coffeemaker in my office has a built-in grinder that auto grinds and then drips the coffee. Unfortunately  like the Intel 432  this machine was too complex -- thus the vender has discontinued production of the machine. I am currently searching for a machine of equivalent functionality for the day my one remaining machine dies. Return to Faculty Home Page',\n",

Most of the stuff is in the usr/ subdirectory. The rest is currently empty. Technical Reports and lists of abstracts: my own technical reports  and related reports of my students and colleagues. CIS technical reports. *** (still under construction) *** Web-aware sparse matrix collection: I maintain a large collection of sparse test matrices. Each matrix has its own web page  with statistical information on the matrices and a small picture of the nonzero pattern. Click here for sparse matrices and patterns. Also available via ftp. Other useful collections of sparse matrices include the Harwell/Boeing collection and the SPARSKIT2 collection of sparse matrices. Our web site gives you static pictures of sparse matrices - the advantage being that you don t have to download the whole matrix. A dynamic viewer (assuming that you have the matrix) can give more information. The Emily package is one such example. The Approximate Minimum Degree ordering algorithm (AMD): ********* Now released (Jan. 18  1996) ********** AMD will appear as MC47 in Release 12 of the Harwell Subroutine Library. Related AMD variants (not AMD itself  however) are available for non-commercial use in NETLIB and via anonymous ftp at this site. Take a look at my technical report lists for more information  or click here for a set of transparencies from a talk given at the International Linear Algebra Year  Direct Methods Workshop  September 1995  hosted by CERFACS in Toulouse  France. Or  click here for a one-page abstract of the talk. For papers related to the talk  see  An approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm  and  A combined unifrontal/multifrontal method for unsymmetric sparse matrices.  UMFPACK: a package for solving sparse linear systems: ********* Version 2.0 is now released! (Sept. 13  1995) ********** ********* Version 2.1(Beta) is also released (Dec. 7  1995) ********** See T. A. Davis and I. S. Duff   A combined unifrontal/multifrontal method for unsymmetric sparse matrices   TR-95-020  Submitted to ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software  for more information. The Unsymmetric-pattern MultiFrontal Package (UMFPACK  Version 2.0) solves the linear system Ax=b using LU factorization  where A is a general unsymmetric sparse matrix. The method relies on dense matrix kernels (the BLAS  also see below) to factorize rectangular frontal matrices  which are dense submatrices of the sparse matrix being factorized. As a result  it obtains high performance on RISC-based workstations and vector supercomputers. The package includes a Users  Guide and both double and single precision versions. It requires the BLAS  and two subroutines from the Harwell MA28 code (MC21B and MC13E  available from NETLIB). UMFPACK is freely available for research purposes. For commercial use  UMFPACK Version 2.0 will soon appear as MA38 be placed in the Harwell Subroutine Library. UMFPACK is written in ANSI Fortran 77. A Beta release of UMFPACK Version 2.1 is now available (only by ftp  not in NETLIB). The primary difference with Version 2.0 is that COMPLEX and COMPLEX*16 versions are included in UMFPACK Version 2.1. If you use the Beta release  please let me know (whether or not you encounter any bugs). I ll submit the final release of Version 2.1 once the Beta release is tested in a real application. My test suite of complex matrices is rather limited. Note that the complex versions will not appear in the next release of the Harwell Subroutine Library (for which January 1996 is the target date). This work is in collaboration with Iain Duff  Group Leader of the Numerical Analysis Group of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory  England  and The European Centre for Research and Advanced Training in Scientific Computation (CERFACS). UMFPACK Version 2.0 is also in NETLIB. UMFPACK Versions 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer available  nor supported. Click here for a list of related technical reports. The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms): The Fortran BLAS in NETLIB is a  model implementation.  For best performance of UMFPACK  you should use vendor-optimized BLAS. Alternatively  an excellent optimized BLAS for RISC workstations is available from Michel Dayde  Iain Duff  Antoine Petitet  and Abderrahim Qrichi Aniba. In my experiments on a Sparc 20 Model 41  this optimized BLAS is up to four times faster than the non-optimized BLAS available in NETLIB. You can get the most recent version via anonymous ftp to ENSEEIHT  France. However  since the trans-Atlantic link can be slow  I ve placed a copy (with the authors  permission) at this Univ. of Florida site. Note that the UF copy might not be the most recent  although I will try to keep it up-to-date. Click here for more information about the optimized BLAS. FLOODS/FLOOPS: Florida Object Oriented Device/Process Simulators: UMFPACK has been incorporated as the primary sparse factorization code in the FLOODS and FLOOPS packages for semiconductor device and process simulation. The two packages are written by Mark Law in the VLSI/TCAD Group of the Electrical Engingeering Department of the University of Florida. For more information  contact Mark Law (law@tcad.ee.ufl.edu).

I m faculty advisor of the Computer Science Undergraduate Association and of the Open Computing Facility. I m also interested in the use of computers in pre-college education; I used to be a high school teacher  and I m involved in the development of the Logo programming language. Berkeley Logo is a freeware interpreter that I wrote along with several students. (Major contributors are Dan van Blerkom  Michael Katz  and Doug Orleans.) Click here to retrieve the complete distribution archive for Unix  DOS  or Mac  complete with C source code. (If you think Logo is just a graphics language for little kids  check out a sample program that should impress you.) Intermediate Programming  a Logo programming text that concentrates on natural language processing rather than the graphics most people associate with Logo. Projects  Styles  and Techniques  a collection of ten largeish Logo programs with commentary on the structure and style of each. Advanced Topics  brief introductions to six college-level computer science topics. The Computer Science Logo Style books are out of print  but you can order a bound photocopy from MIT Document Services. The second edition should be published early in 1997. I ve written several papers about computers and education. I m a member of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility  the League for Programming Freedom  and the American Civil Liberties Union. So  what do you do for fun  Brian? I visit the Exploratorium  the world s best museum. I watch the Animaniacs  the only good thing on television. I listen to 1964-1968 British rock  especially the Beatles. I eat Chinese food. I collect art and masks. (Lots of bits in these links.) Check out the world s best turkey stuffing recipe. bh@cs.berkeley.edu',\n",

Baker Previous: Computer Science Faculty Up: Computer Science Faculty Next: Arvind K. Bansal Johnnie W. Baker Full Professor Johnnie W. Baker is the Coordinator for Computer Science. His research interests include parallel algorithms  parallel production systems  application of parallel computers in artificial intelligence  parallel computational geometry  computational chemistry  and parallel computer models. He has also published in the areas of Banach spaces and general topology. Baker received a B.S. degree in mathematics from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene  Texas in 1958  a M.S. and Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1965 and 1968 respectively  from the University of Texas in Austin. He was an assistant professor at Florida State University before joining the faculty at Kent State University in 1973. He is a member of ACM and the Computer Society of the IEEE. Recent Research Activities: A major focus of Baker s recent research has been the development of a computational model for associative computing and establishing algorithms and software for this model. The associative model is designed to provide a common platform for the development of appropriate algorithms and software for massively parallel computers in general and an extended version of SIMD computers in particular. Current work is underway to compare this model to other parallel models of computation  including the reconfigurable mesh and the mesh with multiple broadcasts. Other current research interests include developing improved constant time algorithms requiring fewer processors for the reconfigurable mesh  embedding and emulating hypercubes on a 3-D mesh architecture  and developing parallel algorithms and improved sequential algorithms that require less memory and running time for modeling organic compounds at the molecular level.

The parallel version we are implementing under this project would allow a user to interactively select and change color models in real time.

Downey Peter J. Downey is Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Arizona. He received a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1974  and joined the faculty at the Pennsylvania State University. In 1978 he moved to Arizona. Downey s main research area is probabilistic analysis of algorithms and systems  with particular emphasis on modeling the performance of parallel algorithms. These areas are described in detail below. During the 1996-97 academic year  Downey is on sabbatical leave  but can be reached at the addresses below.

In order to understand the origins and effects of overheads in parallel computation  such as synchronization delays  methods focus on probabilistic models of workloads and task processing times. Rather than developing exact but unrealistic models with only narrow applicability  emphasis is on the development of bounds and approximations that are robust and valid for extremely general workload and task distributions (distribution-free methods). For large workloads and massive numbers of parallel processors  laws of large number apply and allow run-time and speed-up to be approximated or bounded in terms of a few underlying parameters of the workload. Analysis of Overheads Analysis of parallel algorithms is distinctly different from that of sequential algorithms because of the presence of overheads  following from the need to coordinate parallel activity. Overheads are of two fundamentally different kinds. Explicit overheads result from the need to add additional code to a parallel algorithm to handle coordination matters such as forks and message sends. Implicit overheads arise from delays spent waiting on synchronization events  such as joins  to occur. Implicit and explicit overheads increase with increasing degree of parallelism; expected implicit overheads increase with the mean  variance and skewness of the underlying task time distributions. Much of this research aims to quantify the effects of such overheads  and to understand how they depend on various parameters of the workload distribution. Work on this subject includes Bounds and Approximations for Overheads in the Time to Join Parallel Forks   ORSA Journal on Computing 7  2(Spring 1995)  125-139. Foundations: Extreme Order Statistics Let X1  ...   Xn be random variables  representing execution times of tasks. Two random variables derived from the task times play a critical role in determining the performance of parallel activity: the extreme Mn = max ( X1  ...   Xn) and the sum Sn = X1 + ... + Xn. Work aimed at understanding the behavior of both Sn and Mn for large n  even if the task times are dependent  forms a fundamental part of this research upon which all analysis is based. This foundational theory must meet a very practical methodological constraint: to be able to bound or approximate the behavior of extrema and sums without detailed information about the task workload distributions. Work in this area includes The Ratio of the Extreme to the Sum in a Random Sequence with Applications   with P.E. Wright  University of Arizona Technical Report TR 94-18 (1994). Scheduling and Sequencing Parallel performance issues occur at the operating systems level in the design of multiprocessor schedulers. The design and analysis of simple scheduling policies having guaranteed performance bounds is an important part of this research. New applications of stochastic ordering relations to prove optimality of static scheduling policies and to develop bounds for dynamic policies are being extended as part of this work. New work in this area includes Scheduling Independent Tasks to Minimize the Makespan on Identical Machines   with E.G. Coffman  Jr. and J. Bruno  Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences 9  3(Fall 1995)  447-456.

Flaherty flaherje@cs.rpi.edu Amos Eaton ProfessorPh.D. Polytechnic Institute of BrooklynNumerical Analysis  Scientific Computation and Adaptive Methods Flaherty came to Rensselaer from New York University in 1973. Since his arrival  he has been studying scientific computation and is currently investigating adaptive methods for differential equations. He has recently become interested in developing versions of these methods that will run on a variety of parallel computers. His goal is developing automatic systems for solving partial differential equations. These systems will allow scientists and engineers to describe problems in a natural way  automatically select appropriate numerical techniques  solve the equations to a prescribed level of accuracy  and display the results. His software is adaptive. It can automatically change numerical methods and can move  create or destroy finite difference or finite element meshes while the system is solving the equations and learning more about their properties. Flaherty s techniques are general  and thus capable of helping engineers confront and describe phenomena such as stresses in metals  aerodynamics  pollution dispersion in lakes  and temperatures in nuclear reactor vessels. These problems are typical of many practical situations where small scale structures form  evolve  propagate  and decay during the course of calculating the solution. Reliable  robust and efficient software that automatically captures and resolves the phenomena as they appear would be very useful to scientists and engineers who may not know the nature or location of the situation beforehand. His major successes have been in one- and two-dimensional transient systems. His work relies heavily on the use of computer graphics so that scientists and engineers can easily specify their problems and visualize their results. He and fellow researchers are starting to investigate adaptive methods for three-dimensional problems and procedures that are suitable for parallel computers. Embedded data structures within the adaptive procedures can be exploited to develop efficient parallel strategies. Faculty and Their Research',\n",

I am a member of the High Performance Transaction Processing Group Traditional algorithms for controlling concurrent access to shared data  by requiring serializable execution  may unduly restrict concurrency  and hence performance  in situations where data is accessed heavily or distributed or where transactions run for long periods of time. We have explored a variety of techniques for dealing with these problems  including the use of optimistic algorithms  multi-version data  and replication. Recently we developed algorithms for improving concurrency by allowing limited violations of database integrity constraints. Synchronization can be relaxed if integrity constraints are not strictly enforced. By controlling synchronization  perhaps in a state-dependent way  the extent of the violation can be controlled. Violations can be corrected through appropriate compensation. We are currently investigating the extent to which the semantics of transactions (expressed as proofs in a formal system) can be exploited to improve performance. We use semantics in several ways: to define a new correctness criterion for concurrent (non-serializable) transaction execution  to decompose transactions into smaller units so that locks can be released early  and to design a new concurrency control that guarantees correct execution when these units are interleaved. We are taking two approaches to transaction decomposition. In the first we decompose a transaction into a sequence of steps. Steps are atomic and isolated and release all conventional locks when they complete. A new concurrency control and lock mode is required to implement this approach. The second approach guarantees correctness using only conventional locks  but in a non-two-phase fashion. The algorithms are being implemented and a test bed constructed to evaluate the ideas. We are also interested in the use of transaction semantics to better understand problems associated with federated databases and compensation.

I work on Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI  ) architectures. This research falls in the realm of Artificial Intelligence. The task is to build models of rational cognitive agents that are endowed with beliefs  desires  and intentions. Most of my work has so far been carried in conjuction with the SNePS Research Group. SNePS is a semantic network processing system. The illustration below shows a SNePS representation of the sentences: All humans are mortal. Socrates is human. The above illustration is from January 1991 issue of Scientific American article Silicon babies where Stu Shapiro was interviewed after I had presented some results from my thesis at the AAAI Spring Symposium on Integrated AI Architectures. In the summer of 1994  I spent some time traveling in Southern Utah. The pictures below are of Newspaper Rock People from various eras have left their marks on this rock.

Hovy Biographical Information Ugly photo. Pretty photo. Research Interests Currently heading the Natural Language Processing group at USC/ISI doing research on various aspects of natural language processing  specifically on Machine Translation and automated text planning and generation. Am personally involved in five research directions: the construction of the Pangloss family of machine translation systems (this work originally in conjunction with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and New Mexico State University); the development of theories of discourse structure and the construction of multisentence text and sentence planning systems (this work in collaboration with researchers at the Universities of Waterloo and Toronto in Canada); the development of sentence generation theory and systems  including management of the Penman project; the development of theory to address problems in multimedia human-computer communication (in collaboration with people at ISI); and the development of MEDTRANS  a system to translate and convey forms and information among Health Care providers (this work in collaboration with the DSSA group at ISI). My Ph.D. (Computer Science  Yale University  1987) focused on the development of a text generation program that took into account the pragmatic aspects of communication  since the absence of sensitivity toward hearer and context has been a serious shortcoming of generator programs written to date. I am interested in all facets of communication  especially human language  as used to express intelligence.

Currently  I am building the Distributed Systems and Communication lab at the Department of Computer Science here at Hopkins  and also am affiliated with the Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Sciences (CESDIS)  The Goddard Space Flight Center  NASA. The main project in the Distributed Systems and Communication lab is Commedia  a cross-platform infrastrcuture for multimedia conferencing. Commedia will combine a reliable multicast toolkit (Spread) with video  voice  graphics  and application sharing over local and wide area networks. The development is done over BSDI Unix and WIN95. We are just strating  so it is not too late to join! Since I received my B.Sc.  I gained vast experience in building distributed systems. I spent six years building such a defense system  heading a 50 man-years effort and delivering an operational solution to the customer. Subsequently  I spent four years researching and building (i.e. playing with) distributed systems  network protocols and replicated databases. And guess what: I even got a PhD for that :) I was one of the initiators and main participants of the Transis project with Professor Danny Dolev at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  Israel. Transis is a group communication tool that supports reliable multicast services over a partitioned network. Transis utilizes the hardware unreliable multicast where possible  optimizing the performance for existing networks. I also took part in building the Totem group communication protocol with Professors Melliar-Smith and Moser at the University of California  Santa Barbara.

Dr. Tibor R. Machan  professor of philosophy at Auburn University  in  The Welfare State and the News  as reported in the December  1996  issue of the  Freeman  magazine: Except for the editors of the few papers and magazines that champion liberty  none of those in charge will encourage truly critical scrutiny of mainstream political affairs. None will raise such questions as  Why should government deprive the successful of the fruits of their success  or even the fortunate of their good fortune  just because others do not enjoy the same?  Or who among those who feed off the welfare state so successfully would ever raise the question:  Mr. President  if we spend borrowed money our children will have to be taxed to repay  does this not violate the principle  No taxation without representation ?  Would any such journalist raise the question to some politician or bureaucrat:  If in the criminal law it is wrong to punish people unless they have been proven guitly of a crime  why is it right that government regulations may impose enormous economic burdens on people who have done nothing wrong? Isn t this a kind of prior restraint that has no place in a free society?  What about the question:  If the 14th Amendment prohibits the unequal application of the law  why are producers prohibited from discriminating  while consumers can do so with total impunity? And why can government regulate every profession but the press  arts  and clergy--is this not a built-in inequality  a state-sponsored discrimination?  Leonard E. Read (1898-1983)  Founding President of FEE  the Foundation for Economic Education  said that  in an ideal America  every person should be free: ... to pursue his ambition to the full extent of his abilities  regardless of race or creed or family background. ... to associate with whom he pleases for any reason he pleases  even if someone else thinks it s a stupid reason. ... to worship God in his own way  even if it isn t  orthodox.  ... to choose his own trade and to apply for any job he wants--and to quit his job if he doesn t like it or if he gets a better offer. ... to go into business for himself  be his own boss  and set his own hours of work--even if it s only three hours a week. ... to use his honestly acquired property or savings in his own way--spend it foolishly  invest it wisely  or even give it away. ... to offer his services or products for sale on his own terms  even if he loses money on the deal. ... to buy or not to buy any service or product offered for sale  even if the refusal displeases the seller. ... to disagree with any other person  even when the majority is on the side of the other person. ... to study and learn whatever strikes his fancy  as long as it seems to him worth the cost and effort of studying and learning it. ... to do as he pleases in general  as long as he doesn t infringe the equal right and opportunity of every other person to do as he pleases.

Houk) Subject: The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the USA Finding myself in the general neighborhood of Our Great Nation s Murder Capital  with a few spare hours on my hand  I decided to risk life and limb by braving the Throbbing Hoards (of Tourists) and check out just what the Bill of Rights actually does say. I went to the United State National Archives building and did myself in person personnally look at and peruse the Bill of Rights. The real Bill of Rights. The 200-year-old  paper   signed by John Adams and Frederick Muhlenberg. The document from which were ratified the first ten amendments to the United State Constitution  and in particular  the second amendment protecting the right to keep and bear arms. I have reproduced below various text bodies leading up to the second amendment  all taken from facsimiles of documents leading up to the Bill of Rights. Text within bracket ( [] ) characters is mine  identifying the following verbatim text; text within double brackets ( [[]] ) is explanatory comment. Obviously  I cannot produce a facsimile of the original documents here  the best I can do is to provide an ASCII representation of the body of text. I have preserved the actual grammar  spelling  punctuation  and line breaks as nearly as possible within the constraints of 80-column ASCII terminals. I have tried very hard to not make any transcription error  proofing the copy several times on different days.

It was signed by Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg  Speaker of the House  on September 28  1789  and by John Adams  President of the Senate  shortly therafter. The Bill of Rights  as this parchment copy is now known  is on permanent display in the Rotunda of the National Archives Building.

With the admission of North Carolina  Rhode Island  and Vermont during the ratification period  11 states had to ratify the articles in order to achieve the three-fourths majority required by the Constitution. In the ensuing two and one-half years  the first article proposed by Congress was approved by only 10 states  the second by only 6. Articles 3 through 12 received the approval of the necessary 11th state when Virginia ratified them on December 15  1791. Accordingly  articles 3 through 12 became the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. [[List of states and dates of ratification omitted]] Three states--Massachusetts  Connecticut  and Georgia--did not ratify the first 10 amendments until the celebration of the Sesquicentennial of the Constitution in 1939. [Amendment II] [[Twenglish spelling]] A well regulated Militia  being necessary to the security of a free State  the right of the people to keep and bear Arms  shall not be infringed. ---------------------- And that s the way it is.

Do you conclude from this that only voters may own books? Do you believe that all  inflammatory  books should be stored in libraries  since no honest person needs such a book at home where a child might read it? Does this statement make you want to register books  or ban some of them  or prevent them from being read in public? Should there be a waiting period for the purchase of  dangerous  books  magazines  and newspapers? Should speed reading courses be restricted to police and military to prevent  assault reading  by citizens? Do you think that banning legal possession of easily-concealed novels will stop criminals from reading? Should we stop teaching children to read  since what they might read could be harmful to them?  At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some trans-Atlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us with a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe  Asia and Africa combined with a Bonaparte at their head and disposing of all the treasure of the earth  our own excepted  could not by force make a track on the Blue Ridge or take a drink from the Ohio in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer  if it ever reach us it must spring up from amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot  we ourselves must be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men  we must live through all times  or die by suicide.  --Abraham Lincoln  1838:  This country  with its institutions  belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government  they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it  or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.   If the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be fixed by decisions of the supreme Court  then the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.  --Abraham Lincoln  First Inaugural Address  March 4  1861:  ... the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme Court  ... the people will have ceased to be their own rulers  having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.   If I don t have to do it  it only shows that you don t have to either.   We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing.   We  the People are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts - not to overthrow the Constitution  but to overthrow men who pervert the Constitution.   Am I not destroying my enemies when I make friends of them?  --Abraham Lincoln  What constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence? It is not... the guns of our war steamers  or the strength of our gallant and disciplined army... our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in our bosoms.  --Abraham Lincoln  1858 So far  no one has been able to verify the following quote:  1935 will go down in History! For the first time  a civilized nation has full gun registration! Our streets will be safer  our police more efficient and the world will follow our lead to the future!  Adolf Hitler  1936 Decree:  A decision of the Fuhrer in the express form of a law or decree may not be scrutinized by a judge. In addition  the judge is bound by any other decision of the Fuhrer  provided that they are clearly intended to declare law.  Adolf Hitler  Edict of 18 March 1938 (or 1939?) (can anyone verify this quote?):  ... history shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subjected peoples to carry arms have prepared their own fall  Adolf Hitler  `Mein Kamph :  If you wish the sympathy of the broad masses  then you must tell them the crudest and most stupid things.  Alan Bock  `Orange County Register :  The median family of four ... paid $4 722 in federal taxes last year. That s enough to pay for a new curtain for the secretary of commerce s office  to bribe a farmer not to plant 38 acres with corn ... seven weeks of salary for a Customs man assigned to save us from the terror of high-quality  low priced foreign TV sets  or the subsidy on 6 000 bushels of wheat to prop up the Soviet regime. Surely civilization would collapse without such essential services.  Albert Einstein   My First Impression of the U.S.A.   1921:  The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this.  Albert Einstein:  Heroism on command  senseless violence  and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -- how passionately I hate them!  Albert Gallatin of the New York Historical Society  7 October 1789:  The whole of the Bill [of Rights] is a declaration of the right of the people at large or considered as individuals... It establishes some rights of the individual as unalienable and which consequently  no majority has a right to deprive them of.  Hamilton didn t argue that a select militia made a general militia unnecessary  but rather that a general militia was insufficient by itself to adequately protect the nation: (Federalist 28 or 29?)  But so far from viewing the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps as dangerous  were the Constitution ratified  and were I to deliver my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature from this State on the subject of a militia establishment  I should hold to him  in substance  the following discourse: `The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious  if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day  or even a week  that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry  and of the other classes of the citizens  to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions  as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia  would be a real grievance to the people  and a serious public inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country  to an amount which  calculating upon the present numbers of the people  would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent  would be unwise: and the experiment  if made  could not succeed  because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be aimed at  with respect to the people at large  than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected  it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year. Alexander Hamilton  collected in Federalist Paper 28  originally in the 10 January  1788   Daily Advertiser :  If the representatives of the people betray their constituents  there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defence which is paramount to all positive forms of government  and which against the usurpations of the national rulers  may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against the rulers of an individual state. In a single state  if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers  the different parcels  subdivisions  or districts of which it consists  having no distinct government in each  can take no regular measures for defense. The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms  without concert  without system  without resource; except in their courage and despair.  Alexander Hamilton  Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of the militia):  Little more can reasonably be aimed at  with respect to the people at large  than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected  it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.  {V}{FF}{RKBA} Alexander Hamilton  Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing armies):  ... if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens  little  if at all  inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms  who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.  {V}{FF}{RKBA} Alexander Hamilton  Federalist Paper 79 (regarding payment of Judges):  In the general course of human nature  A power over a man s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.  {V}{FF} Alexander Hamilton  The Federalist Papers at 184-188 (cannot verify!):  The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.  Alexander Hamilton  advice to jurors to acquit against the judge s instructions:  ... if exercising their judgment with discretion and honesty they have a clear conviction that the charge of the court is wrong.  Hamilton  Federalist #84:  I go further  and affirm that bills of rights  in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for  are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution  but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted; and  on this very account  would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why  for instance  should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained  when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish  to men disposed to usurp  a plausible pretense for claiming that power.  Alexis de Tocqueville:  The American Republic will endure  until politicians realize they can bribe the people with their own money.  Alexis de Tocqueville:  To commit violent and unjust acts  it is not enough for a government to have the will or even the power; the habits  ideas and passions of the time must lend themselves to their committal.  Alexis de Tocqueville:  Where are we then? The religionists are the enemies of liberty  and the friends of liberty attack religion; the high-minded and the noble advocate subjection  and the meanest and most servile minds preach independence; honest and enlightened citizens are opposed to all progress  whilst men without patriotism and without principles are the apostles of civilization and intelligence. Has such been the fate of the centuries which have preceded our own? and has man always inhabited a world like the present  where nothing is linked together  where virtue is without genius  and genius without honor; where the love of order is confounded with a taste for oppression  and the holy rites of freedom with a taste for law; where the light thrown by conscience on human actions is dim  and where nothing seems to be any longer forbidden or allowed  honorable or shameful  false or true?  Algernon Sidney (1672):  The only ends for which governments are constituted  and obedience rendered to them  are the obtaining of justice and protection; and they who cannot provide for both give the people a right of taking such ways as best please themselves  in order to their own safety.  Andrew Ford (UseNet):  The price of liberty is  always has been  and always will be blood: The person who is not willing to die for his liberty has already lost it to the first scoundrel who is willing to risk dying to violate that person s liberty! Are you free?  Andrew Ford (UseNet):  Without either the first or second amendment  we would have no liberty; the first allows us to find out what s happening  the second allows us to do something about it! The second will be taken away first  followed by the first and then the rest of our freedoms.  Andrew Jackson  8th Annual Message to Congress (Dec 5  1836):  It is apparent from the whole context of the Constitution as well as the history of the times which gave birth to it  that it was the purpose of the Convention to establish a currency consisting of the precious metals. These were adopted by a permanent rule excluding the use of a perishable medium of exchange  such as certain agricultural commodities recognized by the statutes of some States as tender for debts  or the still more pernicious expedient of paper currency.  Aristotle:  Money being naturally barren  to make it breed money is preposterous  and a perversion from the end of its institution  which was only to serve the purpose of exchange and not of increase. . . Usury is most reasonably detested as the increase arises from the money itself  and not by employing it to the purpose for which it was intended.  Benjamin Disraeli:  The world is governed by far different personages than what is imagined by those not behind the scenes.  Benjamin Franklin  1759 (Franklin B. Historical Review of Pennsylvania. 1759):  They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.  {V}{FF}{RKBA} Benjamin Franklin  before the Constitutional Convention  (June 2  1787):  ... as all history informs us  there has been in every State & Kingdom a constant kind of warfare between the governing & governed: the one striving to obtain more for its support  and the other to pay less. And this has alone occasioned great convulsions  actual civil wars  ending either in dethroning of the Princes  or enslaving of the people. Generally indeed the ruling power carries its point  the revenues of princes constantly increasing  and we see that they are never satisfied  but always in want of more. The more the people are discontented with the oppression of taxes; the greater need the prince has of money to distribute among his partisans and pay the troops that are to suppress all resistance  and enable him to plunder at pleasure. There is scarce a king in a hundred who would not  if he could  follow the example of Pharoah  get first all the peoples money  then all their lands  and then make them and their children servants for ever ...  Benjamin Franklin  letter to the French Ministry March 1778:  He who shall introduce into public affairs the principle of primitive Christianity will change the face of the world.  Benjamin Franklin:  Taxes on consumption  like those on capital or income  to be just  must be uniform.  Bill McIntire  Spokesman for the National Rifle Association  on Norfolk  Va. council s vote to cancel four gun shows  1992:  Banning gun shows to reduce violent crime will work about as well as banning auto shows to reduce drunken driving.   Guns cause crime  like flies cause garbage.  --Author unknown. Bob Emmers  `Orange County Register :  The task of government in this enlightened time does not extend to actually dealing with problems. Solving problems might put bureaucrats out of work. No  the task of government is to make it look as though problems have been solved  while continuing to keep the maximum number of consultants and bureaucrats employed dealing with them.  Boyd Crabtree:  We are ignorant of what we ignore.  Bruce A. Budlong  Dept. of the Treasury (1977):  The same monetary system that was established on April 2  1792  is in effect today.  Butler D. Shaffer  Southwestern School of Law  Los Angeles:  Let us go back in time to the point at which we began to allow others to operate as authorities over us  and begin to confront the proposition that others have rightful power over our lives  that others have expertise superior to anything we could ever know on our own. Let us respond to such a proposition as any 3-year old would to anything so palpably absurd:  Why?  /P/ When we relearn to ask such questions - and to ask them of anyone who seeks to advance his or her authority over us - we shall have discovered the way to our psychological independence.  Byron C. Radaker  Chairman and C.E.O.  Congoleum Corp.:  Our government has found that the most effective way to control a person is not by the the ballot or the bullet  but rather by the  bucket . Today  in a country that fought a revolution to rid itself of a repressive government and excessive taxes  government takes 40 percent of everything we earn in the form of taxes.  California citizen attempting to purchase a firearm for self-defense during rioting in Los Angeles  week of 30 April 1992:  What do you mean  wait fifteen days ? This is America!  Calvin Coolidge:  Nothing is easier than spending public money. It does not appear to belong to anybody. The temptation is overwhelming to bestow it on somebody.  Charles A. Beard:  You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go about repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used in the struggle for independence.  Charles Evans Hughes  Justice of the supreme Court (1907):  ... the Constitution is what the judges say it is.  Charlie Chaplin   The Little Dictator :  Dictators free themselves by enslaving others. They work not for your benefit  but their own.  Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone  12th Chief Justice  US supreme Court  1941:  The law itself is on trial quite as much as the cause which is to be decided.  Chief Justice John Jay  1st Chief Justice  US supreme Court (Georgia vs. Brailsford  1794:4):  The jury has a right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy.  Chief Justice John Marshall:  The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws and not men.  Chief Justice Joseph Story  US supreme Court (_Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States_  pp 746-747 (1833)):  The right of the citizen to keep and bear arms has justly been considered the palladium of the liberties of the Republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and the arbritrary powers of rulers  and will generally -- even if these are successful -- enable the people to resist and triumph over them.  {V}{RKBA} Chief Justice Marlin T. Phelps  Arizona supreme Court:  Nothing was further from the minds of the Framers of the Constitution  than that the supreme Court should ever make the Supreme Law of the Land.  Chief Justice Warren Burger:  Ours is a sick profession. [A profession marked by] incompetence  lack of training  misconduct  and bad manners. Ineptness  bungling  malpractice  and bad ethics can be observed in court houses all over this country every day.  Congressional Record Vol. 90 Sec. 271 (b)(1) p.2243 (1939):  Under this bill we are trying our best to eliminate tax returns for some 30 000 000 of our individual taxpayers by allowing them to use the so-called W-2 form  which results in the taxpayer not computing his own tax but having his tax computed by the collector ... This whole thing is for the purpose of removing complications and difficulties that have arisen by reason of the enactment of the so-called pay-as-you-go system.  Congressman George Hansen:  If a tactic you try irritates the I.R.S. and its agents  you can assume it is legal - remember it for future use.  Congressman Jerry Voorhis:  The banks -- commercial banks and the Federal Reserve -- create all the money of this nation and its people pay interest on every dollar of that newly created money. Which means that private banks exercise unconstitutionally  immorally  and ridiculously the power to tax the people. For every newly created dollar dilutes to some extent the value of every other dollar already in circulation.  Congressman Wright Patman:  Mr. Eccles [Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board]  how did you get the money to buy those two billion of government securities? ; Eccles:  We created it.  Congressman Patman:  Out of what? ; Eccles:  Out of the right to issue credit money.   The House Banking and Currency Committee; September 30  1941 Congressman Wright Patman  Chairman  House Banking Committee:  In the United States today we have in effect two governments ... We have the duly constituted Government ... Then we have an independent  uncontrolled and uncoordinated government of the Federal Reserve System  operating the money powers which are reserved to Congress by the Constitution.  Daniel Boorstin `The mysterious Science of the Law :  In the first century of American independence  the [Blackstone] Commentaries were not merely an approach to the study of the law; for most lawyers they constituted all there was of the law.  Daniel Webster  Speech on Hamilton:  He smote the rock of the national resources and abundant streams of revenue gushed forth. He touched the dead corpse of public credit  and it sprang upon its feet.  Daniel Webster:  God grants liberty only to those who love it  and are always ready to guard and defend it.  Daniel Webster:  Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers of good inte',\n",

This is partly due to the difficulty in writing parallel programs in a message-passing environment  and partly due to the high communication cost over the network. Some progress has been made through Distributed Shared Memory systems that present a shared memory programming abstraction  and which minimize communication using weak coherence. Some progress has also been made through compilers that can generate parallel code directly. My research is aimed at extending this progress on both fronts  primarily through parallel compilation techniques targeted to Distributed Shared Memory environments. This work is focused in three areas: 1) targeting to weakly coherent systems; 2) improving locality to reduce communication; and 3) exploring and improving the interaction between the compiler and run-time systems.

Research Interests Negotiation among computationally bounded self-interested agents  multiagent systems  distributed problem solving  distributed artificial intelligence  negotiation  coalition formation  electronic commerce  resource-bounded reasoning  normative methods for system design  machine learning  combinatorial optimization  scheduling. My primary interests lie in inherently distributed combinatorial problems - resource and task allocation and scheduling among agents with different levels of autonomy  e.g. representing different real world enterprises that are seeking synergies by limited cooperation. Such settings occur for example in production scheduling in multi-enterprise agile manufacturing  in negotiations with real-world subcontractors  in vehicle routing among dispatch centers of different companies  in meeting scheduling  in classroom scheduling etc. I am studying different commitment strategies and protocols in multiagent systems  and the possibility of carrying out contracts without external enforcement. I have studied the role of marginal costs as a basis for negotiation and questions of bounded rationality and deliberation scheduling when the exact computation of marginal costs is intractable. I have also analyzed the effect of asynchrony and message congestion among negotiators and greater domain risk tolerance to enhance the negotiation process computationally. I am currently studying the usefulness of distributed versions of a variety of combinatorial optimization algorithms from the AI and OR communities. Some other research issues that I am currently addressing are: using machine learning techniques to alternate between different negotiation strategies based on dynamic properties of the environment  cost-based constraint relaxation  anticipation of future contracts in an agent s negotiation strategy  fair on-line profit division schemes among agents  and contracts involving multiple agents as opposed to just two. Lately  I have also developed a normative theory of coalitions among bounded rational agents. My secondary interest is machine learning. On the theoretical side  I lately coauthored a paper that disproved a justification for biasing decision tree induction algorithms towards generating trees with few leaves. I have also coauthored an empirical paper that studied the applicability of Q-learning to multiagent settings. On the applied side I am currently - in cooperation with domain experts who actually need the solution - comparing a number of symbolic induction methods and neural network algorithms to enhance classification accuracy in a real-world biological problem. Specifically  we use the methods to predict morbidity and mortality in equine colic. Education Ph.D.  Computer Science  University of Massachusetts at Amherst  September 1996. GPA 4.0.

Java for Wavelets Java is still a bit painful  but it provides extraordinary potential for use in research and teaching. Here is a small collection of subdivision and wavelet related applets that students  collaborators  and I myself have written. Check them out! A simple demonstration of how to draw smooth curves through corner cutting (and my first attempt at Java...). This is an instance of subdivision which is intricately linked to wavelet constructions. One of the students in CS274b  Dmitri Linde  took this applet as a starting point for his homework assignment. It demonstrates B-splines and Bezier curves of varying order and lenght all rolled into one application. They are all generated through subdivision. Dmitri Linde also implemented his CS274b project in Java. AWESOME! Wim Sweldens wrote a little applet that allows you to explore the space of all four tap wavelets. Watch this space for more to come as Mike Astle and Dae Kang start hacking Java this summer! News I was just named a Sloan Foundation Fellow (Caltech Press Release) and an NSF National Young Investigator to work on ``Wavelet Methods: Connecting Theory and Application.

So far this has been happening under the headline of wavelets  but we are generalizing the ideas more and more  so whether it should still be called wavelets is up to debate. An overview of research projects in the computer graphics group as a whole gives some more ideas about concrete projects that are happening or about to happen. Publications Almost everything is available online but not all of it in fancy html yet. Here are a few Wavelets in Computer Graphics course notes for Siggraph 96 (with Wim Sweldens  Michael Cohen  Tony DeRose  and David Salesin). The first two chapters are the latest (and much improved...) guide to ``Building Your Own Wavelets at Home.   Interpolating Subdivision for Meshes with Arbitrary Topology (with Denis Zorin and Wim Sweldens)  CS-TR-96-6. Final Siggraph version and some cool pix: Mannequin  Tetrahedron  Pipes  and Venus (David coming soon...) Wavelets in Computer Graphics  to appear in a special issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE. Spherical Wavelets: Efficiently Representing Functions on the Sphere (with Wim Sweldens)  appeared in Proceedings of Siggraph 95. Spherical Wavelets: Texture Processing (with Wim Sweldens)  appeared in Rendering Techniques `95  Springer Verlag. Textures and Radiosity: Controlling Emission and Reflection with Texture Maps  (with Reid Gershbein  and Pat Hanrahan)  appeared in Proceedings of Siggraph 94. Wavelet Image Compression appeared in Wired Magazine  3.05  May 1995. On the Formfactor between Two Polygons (with Pat Hanrahan)  appeared in Proceedings of Siggraph 93. There is also a TR version which gives all the gory details  Mathematica Code  and even a C library which implements the form factor expression (of course without any guarantees that it will always work...). Building Your Own Wavelets at Home (with Wim Sweldens)  appeared as a TR. Data Parallel Volume Rendering as Line Drawing (with Gordon Stoll)  appeared in Proceedings of ACM Volume Visualization Workshop  1992. I have also contributed to the Siggraph notes for the Wavelets in Computer Graphics course held at Siggraph 95  Los Angeles. Copyright 漏 1995  1996 Peter Schr枚der',\n",

Watson  Sr.  Professor of Computer Science THEORY OF COMPUTATION Professor Rabin studies the theory and application of computer algorithms. His special interests are computer security and applications of randomization in computations. One project involves the use of sophisticated algorithms to protect computer files and a computer s operating system against unauthorized intrusion (i.e.  against  hackers ). With a doctoral student  D. Tygar (now at CMU)  Professor Rabin invented a new model for computer security and a series of tools which can be incorporated into existing and future operating systems to ensure their protection. The system  called ITOSS (Integrated Toolkit for Operating System Security)  has been implemented and is being tested. Work on extensions  including the development of a user interface  is in progress. The new technologies of parallel computers and distributed systems raise important theoretical and practical problems concerning interprocessor communications and the coordination and synchronization of distributed computing processes. Professor Rabin has developed an innnovative algorithm called IDA (Information Dispersal Algorithm) for the dispersal of information. He is studying the applications of IDA to efficient and fault-tolerant routing of information in parallel computers and general networks  and to the storage of information in arrays of disks (RAIDs). Professor Rabin also continues to work at creating efficient algorithms for problems in algebra  number theory  data structures  and combinatorics. In addition to their theoretical interest  many of these algorithms  including one recently devised for pattern-matching  have important practical significance. M. O.

Everything in the system is a first class object with well defined behavior. The computational model is one of applying behaviors to objects. The multimedia project addresses the issue of providing data management support for multimedia applications. The general approach incorporates an object-oriented type system and distributed objectbase functionality. Enterprise is a programming environment for designing  coding  debugging  testing  monitoring  profiling and executing programs in a distributed hardware environment. Enterprise code looks like familiar sequential code since the parallelism is expressed graphically and is independent of the code. The system automatically inserts the code necessary to correctly handle communication and synchronization  allowing the rapid construction of distributed programs. This helps bridge the complexity gap between distributed and sequential software.

MULTEXT-EAST at univ-aix Multilingual Texts and Corpora for Eastern and Central European Languages Site. Corpus Encoding Standard. March 1996. From the abstract  The CES has been designed to be optimally suited for use in language engineering research and applications  in order to serve as a widely accepted set of encoding standards for European corpus work...The CES specifies a minimal encoding level that corpora must achieve to be considered standardized in terms of descriptive representation (marking of structural and typographic information) as well as general architecture (so as to be maximally suited for use in a text database). It also provides encoding specifications for linguistic annotation  together with a data architecture for linguistic corpora.  CES DTDs The latest versions of the CES DTDs. From this location you can see the DTDs themselves. CES DTDs via dtd2html From here you can explore a navigable view (using dtd2html) of each dtd. tagusage This short shell script writen by Heiki-Jaan Kaalep and then modified by me will do the tag usage calculations for you and and format it in so you can just paste it into your TEI or CES header (or any other DTD that wants tagusage). It is dependent on the unix carriage return so it will probably need to be modified to work under dos. See the script Using Cyrillic Entities with Emacs psgml mode I have a system that lets you type the keys you would normally type to generate a character but when you are in psgml mode it generates the entitiy for this character  so you can type normaly and be inserting entities. It would work equally well for other character sets (ISOlat1 or 2)  I just had a need for cyrillic so that is the one I set up. If you want to find out more you can read the HowTo file. I am looking some for people to try this out and give me feedback before I put it up for public consumption.

VITA PUBLICATIONS (this section is under construction) Unscheduled traces and shared-memory multiprocessor simulation   Patricia J. Teller  NMSU Technical Report NMSU-CSTR-9426  1995. Abstract. Trace-driven simulation of shared-memory architectures can be as accurate as execution- or program-driven simulations for a large class of parallel programs. Traces for programs in this class can be scheduled or unscheduled. A scheduled trace is a set of traces generated by running a parallel program on a real or simulated MP  while an unscheduled trace is an augmented trace generated by running a parallel program on a uniprocessor. Scheduled traces can be used to drive simulations of only MP systems with the same number of processors as the MP that generated the trace and are limited to the same static task-to-processor scheduling as the MP that generated the trace. In contrast  unscheduled traces offer much more flexibility. In this paper we show how unscheduled traces can be used to simulate dynamic task-to- processor scheduling  MP systems of different sizes  and multiprogramming. In addition  we show how an unscheduled trace allows the task granularity of a traced program to be varied from simulation to simulation and how operating system references can be inserted dynamically during simulation. CS579 Simulation of Computer Architectures . CS579 is a special topics course for graduate students. The course will cover research in the area of simulation of computer architectures  both uniprocessor and multiprocessors architectures.

Glinert glinert@cs.rpi.edu Associate ProfessorPh.D.  University of WashingtonVisual and multimodal human-computer interfaces; computer-based assistive technology for the disabled; multilanguage and multiparadigm programming systems; computer science education and interactive learning. Glinert s research interests center around two overlapping areas. One of these involves the study and design of computing environments. His goal is to develop ways to improve  even revolutionize  the manner in which people interact with the computer. Specific areas of investigation include: visual programming  in which graphics plays a central role alongside text in the human-computer interface; multimodal environments  in which the interface is further augmented (e.g.  through the use of gestures for input and sound for output); and multiparadigm environments  in which users are free to code routines in a single program using a variety of styles which would traditionally require different languages. Glinert s other major research interest involves using computers to assist people with disabilities. Empowering the members of this large community so that they can comfortably and profitably use computers is problematic  because conventional modes of communication  whether with other people or with machines  are often either impossible or at best burdensome. Glinert s goal is to develop concepts and software which will allow many people with disabilities to use conventional hardware and applications programs; this avoids the high cost associated with special devices  and allows the disabled to fit into the mainstream. Together with colleagues within the Department and at the University of California  Glinert is currently working on three NSF-funded projects. One of these seeks to enhance the power of second-generation multimedia environments through incorporation of multimodal objects (which can alternatively present their information in two or more sensory modalities) and hyperwidgets (which extend graphical widgets into the sonic domain). The second project s objective is to make full screen  multiwindow interfaces accessible to users with a variety of visual and hearing impairments. The third project s goal is to improve education in software engineering  through pervasive use of object-oriented techniques and reusable libraries in interactive team projects. Previous research has been supported by DARPA  IBM and Xerox. Glinert is the editor of a two-volume tutorial on visual programming environments published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. In July of 1991  Glinert was elected Chair of the ACM s Special Interest Group for Computers and the Physically Handicapped (SIGCAPH). During 1992-93 he was a member of the Executive Committee of the IEEE CS Task Force on Multimedia Computing. He served as Program Co-Chair for the 1993 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages in Bergen  Norway. Faculty and Their Research',\n",

Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Radiology (75-82)  Associate Professor of Computer Science (82-87)  Professor (87-present); University of Rochester. Co-author of Computer Vision (82). Author of Introduction to Natural Computation (Due 97) Dana Ballard s main research interest is in computational theories of the brain with emphasis on human vision. In 1985 with Chris Brown  he led a team that designed and built a high speed binocular camera control system that is capable of simulating human eye movements. The system is mounted on a robotic arm that allows it to move at one meter per second in a two meter radius workspace. This system has led to an increased understanding of the role of behavior in vision. The theoretical aspects of that system were summarized in a paper ``Animate Vision    which received the Best Paper Award at the 1989 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Dana is also interested in models of the brain that relate to detailed neural models. With Raj Rao  Virginia DeSa  Steve Whitehead and Andrew McCallum  he has been investigating the role of reinforcement learning in the learning of simple tasks such as Block Stacking. The solutions that can be learned are suboptimal but extend to complex environments that cannot be handled by traditional approaches. This work has been the basis for the study of human eye and hand movements using virtual environments. Other research is directed towards learning more general visuo-motor behaviors. Lambert Wixson and Polly Pook have combined the vision system with the Department s Utah dextrous hand. Virginia deSa has studied temporally correlated visuo-motor signals using neural network models. Relevant Publications Ballard  D. H. ``Reference Frames for Animate Vision.

Distributed Computation Laboratory. 9 units (3-3-3); prerequisites: CS138 or equivalent. This laboratory course deals with applications of systematic design methods and theories for reasoning about the correctness and performance of concurrent programs. The theories include temporal logics  computational complexity analysis  probabilistic models  statistics and discrete-event simulation. The first two terms require program development carried out individually or in groups of two  and the third term has a larger project carried out by a team. Concurrent programs are developed using object-oriented languages and methods for single address space and multiple address space systems. User-interface designs are considered within the narrow scope of designing reliable concurrent systems that include human interaction. Aspects of communication protocols for static and mobile systems  distributed operating systems  and fault-tolerant systems are studied with a focus on systematic design to achieve reliability and performance. The course is structured around programming projects using tools such as (but not limited to) Java and the World Wide Web  Unix processes  pipes and sockets  TCP/IP  and multicast protocols  object request brokers such as CORBA  C++ and its extensions such as CC++  and discrete-event simulation packages.

Lewis Harry Lewis Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science THEORY OF COMPUTATION AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS Theoretical computer science has its roots in mathematical logic. In the 1930s  using mathematical automata  Turing investigated whether the truth of mathematical propositions could be determined by algorithmic procedures; since then  studies of formalized computers and formalized mathematical systems have continued to complement and enrich one another. Professor Lewis has worked extensively on the algorithmic solvability of logical  computational  and combinatorial systems  attempting to clarify the relations between them and to identify their common characteristics. For example  he has applied automata theory to the classical predicate calculus and to circuit models for parallel computers. Currently he is working on practical formal methods for design verification of asynchronous systems  such as boolean circuits and signalling protocols. Timing characteristics of such systems are notoriously difficult to validate under realistic models of their behavior  and most practical computer-aided design tools rely on inexhaustive simulation rather than complete verification. Professor Lewis has developed both a theoretical logical framework for the timing specification of asynchronous systems  and software that uses this specification language to verify the functionality of asynchronous boolean circuits whose components have specified minimum and maximum time delays. Professor Lewis is actively involved in the use of computers in education  and his books have had a significant influence on the teaching of the foundations of computer science to undergraduates. H.

Smith Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ARCHITECTURES AND COMPILATION TECHNIQUES FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTER SYSTEMS Individual advances in hardware and software technology continue to spawn advances in the capability and performance of computer systems. As impressive as these advances are  even better systems are often possible if one redesigns the architectural interface that couples the hardware and software. Professor Smith s research focuses on the experimental realization of these innovative compilers and computer architectures. Professor Smith s work consists of the design  implementation  and evaluation of novel architectural mechanisms for high-performance computer systems through the innovative combination of VLSI  compiler  operating system  and network technologies. For the last few years  Professor Smith has worked on superscalar architectures  global instruction scheduling algorithms  and compile-time transformations to improve branch prediction and instruction fetching. Presently  his research team is exploring sophisticated compiler algorithms and novel computer architectures that address the performance needs of multimedia and system-intensive applications.

I am examining the issues of representation  management and manipulation of time in systems. One context of this study is the design and implementation of the advanced hard real-time which we are undertaking in the MARUTI project. The goal of the MARUTI project is to create an environment for the development and deployment of applications with hard real-time systems  fault tolerance  and security requirements. Such applications must be able to execute on a distributed  heterogeneous hardware base.

Brent Michael R. Brent Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science; joint appointment in Computer Science; Ph.D.  Computer Science  MIT  1991 Research Areas Computational models of language acquisition  machine learning of natural language  lexical acquisition  Bayesian learning. Contents Research Summary Preprints and Manuscripts Selected Publications Postdoctoral Position Available Courses Cognitive AI I: Reasoning Machine Learning How to contact me Research Summary My research focuses on developing and testing theories of how people acquire and process language. My approach is to analyze language acquisition and language processing tasks as problems in reasoning under uncertainty. To carry out such an analysis for a particular linguistic task  one must: Make a hypothesis about the sources of information people use to perform the task. Work out a formula for the way in which information of this type affects the probabilities of various linguistic analyses  according to normative rules of conditional probability. This yields a mathematical hypothesis at Marr s computational level about the implications of the information source for the linguistic task. Develop an algorithm by which the language processor could evaluate various linguistic analyses  according to the formula. This requires specifying how the language processor determines which analyses to evaluate  since there are typically far too many to evaluate all of them. Using computer simulation  investigate the extent which the algorithm can perform the task. If the simulations show that the algorithm is effective  use the evaluation formula to make predictions about human behavior and test them by psycholinguistic methods.

I m currently a research faculty member in the U.C. San Diego CS&E Department where I research CS and a little E (every now and then) in a decidedly pedagogical manner. My current interests include heterogeneous computing for performance as well as research in parallel and distributed systems. Consequently  I m housed quite comfortably in the High Performance and Scientific Computing lab. My vita and some of my more recent publication efforts are here as are a bunch of related pointers to other Web locales. Of course  research is not possible without readily accessible coffee and music which luckly are available here in the San Diego area. Occasionally  a movie is also necessary. rich@cs.ucsd.edu',\n",

Arbib Professor Dr. Arbib currently directs a major interdisciplinary project on  Neural Plasticity: Data and Computational Structures   which is integrating studies of learning and neural compensation for disease with research on tools for multi-media database construction  data recovery  visualization and multi-level simulation. His own research focusses on mechanisms underlying the coordination of perception and action. This is tackled at two levels: via schema theory  which is applicable both in top-down analyses of brain function and human cognition as well as in studies of machine vision and robotics; and through the detailed analysis of neural networks  working closely with the experimental findings of neuroscientists. The author of 20 books and the editor of 11 more  Dr. Arbib has most recently edited  The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks   a massive compendium embracing studies in detailed neuronal function  systems models of brain regions  connectionist models of psychology and linguistics  mathematical and biological studies of learning  and technological applications of artificial neural networks.

Current Projects: Portable and Repeatable Parallel Applications: The goal of this project is the creation of software that will help application developers write correct message-passing code. The software will take a trace of the communication events in an MPI (Message Passing Interface) application and determine if the application will always yield the same results given the same inputs. The software will use a novel type of vector clock in order to detect race conditions. Fault-Tolerant Communication Networks: This project studies how communication networks can be designed to tolerate a small number of faults. There are two main goals: 1) the design of networks that can support pipeline (1-D) computations efficiently in the presence of faults  and 2) the creation of techniques that prevent deadlock despite faulty switches or wires.

My work is a blend of human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence. I m interested in building intelligent tools--actually  intelligent assistants--for complex tasks. My dissertation dealt with a system called Aide  an assistant for intelligent data exploration. Aide helps a user to identify and describe interesting patterns in a dataset through interactive exploration. Data exploration is difficult: though a statistical package may take over the burden of computation  still the user must sift through an enormous number of potential patterns and relationships  deciding which procedures are appropriate  and relying on cues in the data and knowledge of external context to guide the process. This domain is a good example of a problem for which the most effective solution involves a collaboration between the user and the system. I m currently extending the ideas developed for Aide into other domains: browsing through the World Wide Web  evaluating and repairing complex plans  and constructing user interface dialogs. My research interests have me splitting my time between human-computer interaction  artificial intelligence  and statistics. Human-computer interaction: I teach a graduate level course in human-computer interaction. Some of my students are very sharp--you can see the results of one of their weekly assignments online. I ve also become involved with the ACM SIGCHI Educational Resource Development Group  working to identify educational resources geared toward HCI. Artificial intelligence: I served on the program committee for the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-96) and I m currently on the program committee for the Second International Conference on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA-97). If you re interested in AI planners  I ve put together a reasonably comprehensive planning resources page. Statistics: I m an associate editor for the Journal of Statistical Software. I also work with people at SAS Institute (who provided part of the funding for my position  in a relatively unusual university/industry partnership.) Here are some useful statistics pages on the Web. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1996 from the University of Massachusetts  where I worked in the Experimental Knowledge Systems Laboratory. My thesis advisor was Paul Cohen  and my committee included Vic Lesser and Arny Rosenberg. My undergraduate days were spent in the Computer Science department at the Johns Hopkins University.

Griswold holds a B.S. degree in physics and M.S and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering  all from Stanford University. He became a member of the Programming Research Department at Bell Laboratories in 1962  where he started research on symbolic computation and the design and implementation of high-level programming languages for non-numeric computation. This work led to the development of the first SNOBOL language. Subsequent work led to the SNOBOL4 programming langauge  which is still in use today. In 1967  he was appointed head of the Programming Research and Development Department at Bell Labs  where he continued his research and also supervised groups involved in a wide range of computer science research. In 1971  he joined the faculty of The University of Arizona as the first Professor of Computer Science. He developed the newly formed department where he was department head until 1981. In 1990 he was appointed Regents  Professor of Computer Science. While at The University of Arizona  he continued his work on programming language design and implementation  which led to the programming languages SL5 and Icon . More recently  he has worked on program visualization and graphics programming. In 1995  he retired to have more time for his research  programming  and graphics interests. Dr. Griswold is the author or co-author of six books on programming languages  the implementation of programming languages  and programming methodology. He presently is co-authoring a book on graphics programming. Links to other things voice: 520-621-6609 fax: 520-621-4246 e-mail: ralph@cs.arizona.edu',\n",

I maintain a system called ITI  which is described in a technical report. The source code and program documentation are also available. More recently  I have been developing a test selection metric based on Kolmogorov-Smirnoff distance  which is also described in a technical report. I am intrigued with problem of how to find good features automatically while learning a value function  particularly in game playing. I have been thinking about practical methods for exploring a space of feature functions. One such approach is described in a recent technical report. This is where I m spending most of my time. I have developed an approach to writing game-playing programs that compete with one another over the internet. The approach does not require a central server  and it allows anyone on the internet to run a contest of player programs located anywhere on the internet. This approach is described in a technical report. Code distributions are available for Othello  Hearts  and Checkers. We have an active Othello group  and a Hearts group of about ten people has just formed in conjunction with seminar on Adversary Search being taught Fall 1996. My own principal interest in game playing pertains to the representational issues in finding good features  but I am very interested in the search aspects too. David Aha maintains a list of people with interests in machine learning and case-based reasoning. Service I am currently serving on the Editorial Board of Machine Learning Journal  and the Organizing Committee of ICML-97. Teaching During Fall 1996 I am teaching the Data Structures course  and a seminary on Adversary Search. Online Publications Utgoff  P. E.

Thompson Department of Computer Science 3190 Merrill Engineering Building University of Utah Salt Lake City  UT 84112 Tel: (801) 585-3302 Fax: (801) 581-5843 thompson@cs.utah.edu Co-Head  with Thomas C. Henderson of the Vision/Robotics Research Group. Current Areas of Interest and Research: Professor Thompson s primary research interest is in the area of computer vision  with an emphasis on problems involving the determination of shape and spatial organization for tasks in robotics. Sensing Strategies for Advanced Manufacturing. Building on Utah s experience in CAGD (computer aided geometric design) for manufacturing  we are investigating novel sensing strategies specifically suited to man-made objects. Current work is addressing the reverse engineering of machined parts based on an approach centering around high-level manufacturing features rather than low-level geometry. Benchmarking of IU for Manufacturing. We are developing a novel approach to providing test data for image understanding. All of the objects making up the test set will be designed and fabricated in-house. This gives us  ground truth  (from the original design data)  control over variablility  and the ability to distribute actual parts with sensed data. Rapid Virtual Prototyping of Assemblies. Immersive interfaces to CAD systems can allow a designer to experiment with assemblies of parts without the need to construct and modify physical prototypes. In this effort  we are constructing a haptic interface so that a designer will be able to touch  hold  and move models of parts and assemblies as well as see them in rendered views. The result will be an environment in which part interactions can be considered in a more natural manner than is possible with current technology. Vision-Based Navigation in Unstructured  Outdoor Terrain. We are developing a model of the process by which current location can be determined from views of outdoor environments and maps representing topographic information. An interdisciplinary approach is used  involving laboratory and field studies of highly expert map readers  computational analysis  and computer simulations. Visual Motion. This project focuses on the analysis of visual motion  including optical flow estimation in the presence of discontinuities  extracting shape properties in a qualitative manner that avoids much of the complexity and noise sensitivity of tranditional structure-from-motion methods  and detecting moving objects in the environment when the sensor might also be moving.

Professor Brunvand joined the Department of Computer Science in 1990. He has interests in computer architecture and VLSI systems in general  and self-timed and asynchronous systems in particular. One aspect of his research involves compiling concurrent communicating programs into asynchronous VLSI circuits. The current system allows programs written in a subset of occam  a concurrent message-passing programming language based on CSP  to be automatically compiled into a set of self-timed circuit modules suitable for manufacture as an integrated circuit. He is also interested in investigating the effects of asynchrony on computer systems architecture at a higher level. To explore these ideas he is building a series of prototype asynchronous computer systems out of FPGA and custom VLSI chips. Asynchronous Circuits Symposia I was recently involved (as co-general-chair) in organizing the first International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (Async94) which was held at the University Park Hotel in Salt Lake City from November 3-5 1994. See the Async94 home page for more details. The 1996 conference  Async96  was held in Aizu  Japan from March 18-21  1996. A rousing success! Check out the Async96 home page for more information. The 1997 confernce  Async97  will be held in Eindhoven  The Netherlands  from April 7-10 1997. The Async97 home page has more details. Asynchronous Circuits Tutorial I gave a tutorial on asynchronous circuits at the 2nd Working Conference on Asynchronous Design Methodologies in London. If you re curious and would like to see the slides  they are available as a postscript file containing the slides  one per page  or in a more compact format as a postscript file with four slides per page. Computer Folklore I gave a paper on computer folklore entitled The Heroic Hacker: Legends of the Computer Age at the American Folklore Society annual meeing in Pittsburgh  PA (October 1996).

Seiferas  URCS Faculty Member b. 1947. Ph.D. (1974) Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Assistant Professor (74-79)  Associate Professor (79); The Pennsylvania State University. Associate Professor (79-present)  Department Chair (81-84); University of Rochester. How can we characterize the structure and complexity of the range of algorithms that solve a fundamental computational problem? What are upper and lower bounds on the computational resources (especially time and space) that are needed  and how do these relate to the capabilities of the computer model being used? What are the right architectures to consider  and what are the best techniques for proving such bounds? These and related questions continue to motivate Joel s interest and research in computer science. Recent research has involved an information-theoretic lower-bound technique based on descriptional complexity and algorithmically incompressible data. Upper bound work has included algorithms for string matching and text indexing  and counter-intuitive real-time simulations of counters and multihead tapes. Recent research supervision and topics courses have involved circuit complexity  probabilistic automata  on-line load balancing  the geometry of string-edit distances  cryptography and multi-party computation  and parallel string matching. Research with current students involves lower and upper bounds on redistribution cost for on-line density control  and space-efficient techniques useful in the simulation of probabilistic automata.
